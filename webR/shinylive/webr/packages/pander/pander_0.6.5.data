Title: An R 'Pandoc' Writer
Type: Package
Encoding: UTF-8
Description: Contains some functions catching all messages, 'stdout' and other
    useful information while evaluating R code and other helpers to return user
    specified text elements (like: header, paragraph, table, image, lists etc.)
    in 'pandoc' markdown or several type of R objects similarly automatically
    transformed to markdown format. Also capable of exporting/converting (the
    resulting) complex 'pandoc' documents to e.g. HTML, 'PDF', 'docx' or 'odt'. This
    latter reporting feature is supported in brew syntax or with a custom reference
    class with a smarty caching 'backend'.

the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;

b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;

c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or 
communicate shall be licensed under this Open Software License;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in 
the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify 
the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor 
reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient 
access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse 
or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to 
Licensorâ€™s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments 
of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in 
this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or 
Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a 
network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 
1(c).

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as 
well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a 
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the 
Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the 
immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the 
warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of 
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law 
prohibits such limitation.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and 
conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of 
recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the 
Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright 
exceptions and limitations (including â€œfair useâ€ or â€œfair dealingâ€). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License 
upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an 
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action 
alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor 
conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties 
of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of 
this License.

13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all 
of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" 
means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible 
for such uses by You.

16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in 
this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate 
your modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified 
License is the "Open Software License" or "OSL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above 
with the notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that 
your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

The main aim of the *pander* [R](https://r-project.org) package is to provide a minimal and easy tool for rendering **R objects** into [Pandoc](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)'s **markdown**. The package is also capable of exporting/converting complex Pandoc documents (reports) in [various ways](#creating-pandoc-documents). Regarding the difference between `pander` and other packages for exporting R objects to different file formats, please refer to this [section](#difference-from-other-rendering-packages).

Current build and test coverage status: [![](https://travis-ci.org/Rapporter/pander.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rapporter/pander) [![](https://codecov.io/github/Rapporter/pander/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/Rapporter/pander?branch=master).

Some CRAN statistics: [![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/pander)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pander) [![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/pander)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pander)

# Installation

The stable version [![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/pander)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pander) can be installed easily in the `R` console like any other package:

```r
install.packages('pander')
```

On the other hand, I welcome everyone to use the most recent version of the package with quick-fixes, new features and probably new bugs. It's currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander). To get the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) of the `devtools` package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

```r
devtools::install_github('Rapporter/pander')
```

## Dependencies

Few cool packages from CRAN are needed for installing and/or using `pander`:

 * [digest](https://cran.r-project.org/package=digest) to compute hashes while caching,
 * [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) to compile certain functions used by the package.

And there are also a few optional suggested or supported R packages, such as:

 * [sylly](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sylly) to use hyphenation when splitting large table cells,
 * [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lattice) and [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) for unified plot theme,
 * [logger](https://cran.r-project.org/package=logger) for logging capabilities inside `evals`,
 * [survival](https://cran.r-project.org/package=survival), [microbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/package=microbenchmark), [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo), [nlme](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nlme), [descr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=descr), [MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MASS), [tables](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tables), [reshape](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reshape), [memisc](https://cran.r-project.org/package=memisc), [Epi](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Epi), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForest), [tseries](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tseries), [rms](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rms) packages include some supported R classes,
 * and *pander* can be also very useful inside of [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr). More information about how to use *pander* and *knitr* can be found specialized vignette, which can be accessed by `vignette('knitr', package = 'pander')` or available online [here](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/knitr.html).

### Pandoc

*pander* heavily builds on [Pandoc](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc), which should be **pre-installed** before trying to convert your reports to [different formats](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). Although **main functions work without Pandoc**, e.g. you can transform R objects into markdown or generate a markdown formatted report via [Pandoc.brew](#brew-to-pandoc) or the custom [reference class](#live-report-generation), but installing that great piece of software is suggested if you want to convert markdown to PDF/docx/HTML or other formats.

Starting v0.98.932 [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) comes with a bundled `Pandoc` binary, so one can save the tedious steps of installing Pandoc.

If you do not have RStudio installed, please refer to the [installation process of Pandoc](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html), which is quite straightforward on most-popular operating systems: download and run the binary (a few megabytes), and get a full-blown document converter in a few seconds/minutes. On some Linux distributions, it might be a bit more complicated (as repositories tend to provide out-dated versions of Pandoc, so you would need `cabal-install` to [install from sources](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html#all-platforms)). Please do not forget to restart your R session to update your `PATH` after installation!

# Helper functions

The package contains numerous helper functions, which render user specified inputs in Pandoc's markdown format or apply some extra formatting on it. All  Pandoc-related functions' names are starting with `pandoc`. For example `pandoc.table` is used for rendering tables in markdown. For a technical documentation, see the HTML help files of the package at [Rdocumentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pander).

<a id="primitive-functions"></a>

All `pandoc` functions generally prints to console and do not return anything by default. If you want the opposite, to get markdown in a string, call each function ending in `.return`, for example `pandoc.table.return`. For more details, please see the official documentation in e.g. `?pandoc.strong`.

The full list of currently available primitive Pandoc-related functions are:

  * pandoc.indent
  * pandoc.p
  * pandoc.strong
  * pandoc.emphasis
  * pandoc.strikeout
  * pandoc.verbatim
  * pandoc.link
  * pandoc.image
  * pandoc.date
  * pandoc.formula
  * pandoc.footnote
  * pandoc.horizontal.rule
  * pandoc.header
  * pandoc.title

<a id="lists"></a>
For example there is a helper function rendering R **lists** into markdown:

```r
> l <- list(
+        "First list element",
+        paste0(1:5, '. subelement'),
+        "Second element",
+        list('F', 'B', 'I', c('phone', 'pad', 'talics')))
> pandoc.list(l, 'roman')
```
Which command produces the following output:
```<%=
l <- list("First list element", paste0(1:5, '. subelement'), "Second element", list('F', 'B', 'I', c('phone', 'pad', 'talics')))
pandoc.list.return(l, 'roman')
%>
```

<a id="tables"></a>

# Markdown tables

One of the most popular feature in *pander* is `pandoc.table`, rendering most tabular R objects into markdown tables with various options and settings (e.g. [style](#style), [caption](#caption), [cell highlighting](#highlight-cells), [cell alignment](#cell-alignment), [width](#table-and-cell-width)). This section aims to provide quick introduction to most common options, but for more usage/implementation details and examples, please refer to specialized vignette, which can be accessed by `vignette('pandoc_table')` or available online [here](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/pandoc_table.html).

Let's start with a small example:

```r
> pandoc.table(mtcars[1:3, 1:4])
```
Which command produces the following output by default:
```<%=mtcars[1:3, 1:4]%>
```

<a id="style"></a><a id="styles"></a>

Please note that all below features are also supported by the more concise `pander` [generic S3 method](#generic-pander-method)!

## Formats

All [four Pandoc formats](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#tables) are supported by *pander*. From those (*multiline*, *simple*, *grid*, *pipe/rmarkdown*), I'd suggest sticking to the default `multiline` format with the most features, except when using `rmarkdown` v1.0 or jupyter notebook, where `multiline` is not supported (for this end the default table format is `rmarkdown` when `pander` is called inside of a jupyter notebook). Please see a few examples below:

<a id="multiline-table"></a>

The default style is the [`multiline` format](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#multiline-tables) (except for calling `pander` inside of a of a jupyter notebook) as most features (e.g. multi-line cells and alignment) are supported:

```rout
> m <- mtcars[1:2, 1:3]
> pandoc.table(m)
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, 1:3])
%>
```

While [`simple` tables](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#simple-tables) are much more compact, but do not support line breaks in cells:

```rout
> pandoc.table(m, style = "simple")
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, 1:3], style = "simple")
%>
```

My personal favorite, the [`grid` format](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#grid-tables) is really handy for [emacs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TableMode) users and it does support line breaks inside of cells, but cell alignment is not possible in most parsers:

```rout
> pandoc.table(m, style = "grid")
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, 1:3], style = "grid")
%>
```

And the so called `rmarkdown` or [pipe table format](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pipe-tables) is often used directly with `knitr`, since it was supporters by the first versions of the `markdown` package:

```rout
> pandoc.table(m, style = "rmarkdown")
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, 1:3], style = "rmarkdown")
%>
```

But once again, you should simply stick to the default [multiline table format](#multiline-table) in most cases. Otherwise, it's wise to update the default table format via [`panderOptions`](#pander-options).

## Caption

It's really easy to add a **caption** to a table:

```rout
> pandoc.table(m, style = "grid", caption = "Hello caption!")
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, 1:3], style = "grid", caption = 'Hello caption!')
%>
```

For more convenient and flexible usage, you might be interested in the special `set.caption` helper function. Call the function at any time, and the next table or plot will catch up the provided caption:

```rout
> set.caption("Hello caption!")
> pandoc.table(m)
<%=
set.caption("Hello caption!")
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, 1:3])
%>
```

Unless `permanent` option is set for `TRUE` (by default), caption will be set only for next table. To disable permanently set caption, just call `set.caption(NULL)` or call `set.caption` with `permanent` parameter being set to `FALSE`.

<a id="highlight-cells"></a>

## Highlighting cells

One of the fanciest features in *pander* is the ease of highlighting rows, columns or any cells in a table. This is a real markdown feature without custom HTML or LaTeX-only tweaks, so all HTML/PDF/MS Word/OpenOffice etc. formats are supported.

This can be achieved by calling `pandoc.table` directly and passing any (or more) of the following arguments **or** calling the R function with the same names before rendering a table with either the `pander` [generic S3 method](#generic-pander-method) or via `pandoc.table`:

* emphasize.italics.rows
* emphasize.italics.cols
* emphasize.italics.cells
* emphasize.strong.rows
* emphasize.strong.cols
* emphasize.strong.cells
* emphasize.verbatim.rows
* emphasize.verbatim.cols
* emphasize.verbatim.cells

The `emphasize.italics` helpers would turn the affected cells to *italic*, `emphasize.strong` would apply a **bold** style to the cell and `emphasize.verbatim` would apply a `verbatim` style to the cell. A cell can be also *italic*,  **bold** and `verbatim` at the same time.

Those functions and arguments ending in `rows` or `cols` take a vector (like which columns or rows to emphasize in a table), while the `cells` argument take either a vector (for one dimensional "tables") or an array-like data structure with two columns holding row and column indexes of cells to be emphasized -- just like what `which(..., arr.ind = TRUE)` returns. A quick-example:

```rout
> t <- mtcars[1:3, 1:5]
> emphasize.italics.cols(1)
> emphasize.italics.rows(1)
> emphasize.strong.cells(which(t > 20, arr.ind = TRUE))
> pandoc.table(t)
<%=
t <- mtcars[1:3, 1:5]
emphasize.italics.cols(1)
emphasize.italics.rows(1)
emphasize.strong.cells(which(t > 20, arr.ind = TRUE))
pandoc.table.return(t)
pandoc.table(t, emphasize.verbatim.rows = 1, emphasize.strong.cells = which(t > 20, arr.ind = TRUE))
%>
```

For more examples, please see our "[Highlight cells in markdown tables](http://blog.rapporter.net/2013/04/hihglight-cells-in-markdown-tables.html)" blog post.

## Cell alignment

You can specify the alignment of the cells (left, right or center/centre) in a table directly by setting the `justify` parameter:

```rout
> pandoc.table(head(iris[,1:3], 2), justify = c('right', 'center', 'left'))
<%=
pandoc.table.return(head(iris[,1:3], 2), justify = c('right', 'center', 'left'))
%>
```

Or pre-define the alignment for (all future) `pandoc.table` or the `pander` [S3 generic method](#generic-pander-method) by a helper function:

```rout
> set.alignment('left', row.names = 'right')
> pandoc.table(mtcars[1:2,  1:5])
<%=
set.alignment('left', row.names = 'right')
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2,  1:5])
%>
```

Just like with [captions](#caption), you can also specify the `permanent` option to be `TRUE` to update the default cell alignment for all future tables. And beside using `set.alignment` helper function or passing parameters directly to `pandoc.table`, you may also set the default alignment styles with [`panderOptions`](#pander-options).

What's even more fun, you can specify a function that takes the R object as its argument to compute some unique alignment for your table based on e.g. column values or variable types:

```rout
> panderOptions('table.alignment.default',
+   function(df)
+     ifelse(sapply(df, mean) > 2, 'left', 'right'))
> pandoc.table(head(iris[,1:3], 2))
<%=
potad <- panderOptions('table.alignment.default')
panderOptions('table.alignment.default', function(df) ifelse(sapply(df, mean) > 2, 'left', 'right'))
pandoc.table.return(head(iris[,1:3], 2))
panderOptions('table.alignment.default', potad)
%>
```

## Table and cell width

`pandoc.table` can also deal with the problem of really **wide tables**. Ever had an issue in LaTeX or MS Word when tried to print a correlation matrix of 40 variables? Not a problem any more as you can split up the table with auto-added captions. The `split.table` option defaults to 80 characters:

```rout
> pandoc.table(mtcars[1:2, ], style = "grid", caption = "Hello caption!")
<%=
gsub('\n\n \n\n', '\n\n', pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:2, ], style = "grid", caption = 'Hello caption!'))
%>
```

And too wide cells can also be split by line breaks. The maximum number of characters in a cell is specified by `split.cells` parameter (default to 30), can be a single value, vector (values for each column separately) and relative vector (percentages of `split.tables` parameter):

```rout
> df <- data.frame(a = 'Lorem ipsum', b = 'dolor sit', c = 'amet')
> pandoc.table(df, split.cells = 5)
<%=
df <- data.frame(a = 'Lorem ipsum', b = 'dolor sit', c = 'amet')
pandoc.table.return(df, split.cells = 5)
%>
> pandoc.table(df, split.cells = c(5, 20, 5))
<%=
pandoc.table.return(df, split.cells = c(5, 20, 5))
%>
> pandoc.table(df, split.cells = c("80%", "10%", "10%"))
<%=
pandoc.table.return(df, split.cells = c("80%", "10%", "10%"))
%>
```

If the `sylly` package is installed, `pandoc.table` can even split the cells with hyphening support:

```rout
> pandoc.table(data.frame(baz = 'foobar'), use.hyphening = TRUE, split.cells = 3)
<%=
pandoc.table.return(data.frame(baz = 'foobar'), use.hyphening = TRUE, split.cells = 3)
%>
```

## Minor features

Funtionality described in other sections is most notable, but `pander/pandoc.table` also has smaller nifty features that are worth mentioning:

* `plain.ascii` - allows to have the output without `markdown` markup:

```rout
> pandoc.table(mtcars[1:3, 1:4])
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:3, 1:4])
%>
> pandoc.table(mtcars[1:3, 1:4], plain.ascii = TRUE)
<%=
pandoc.table.return(mtcars[1:3, 1:4], plain.ascii = TRUE)
%>
```

* `missing` - set a string to replace missing values:

```rout
> m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:5]
> m$mpg <- NA
> pandoc.table(m, missing = '?')
<%=
m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:5]
m$mpg <- NA
pandoc.table.return(m, missing = '?')
%>
```

* `keep.line.breaks` - allows to preserve line breaks inside cells. Not that by default `pandoc.table` automatically omits all line breaks found in each table cell to be able to apply the `table.split` functionality.

```rout
> m <- data.frame(a="foo\nbar", b="pander")
> pandoc.table(m)
<%=
m <- data.frame(a="foo\nbar", b="pander")
pandoc.table.return(m)
%>
> pandoc.table(m, keep.line.breaks = TRUE)
<%=
pandoc.table.return(m, keep.line.breaks = TRUE)
%>
```

To see all possible options, please check [`?pandoc.table`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pander/functions/pandoc.table.return)

And please note, that all above mentioned features are also supported by the `pander` [generic S3 method](#generic-pander-method) and defaults can be updated via [`panderOptions`](#pander-options) for permanent settings.

# Generic pander method

`pander` or `pandoc` (call as you wish) can deal with a bunch of R object types as being a pandocized `S3` generic method with a variety of already supported classes:

<a id="supported-r-classes"></a>

```rout

If you think that pander lacks support for any other R class(es), please feel free to open a [ticket](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pulls) suggesting a new feature or submit [pull request](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues) and we will be happy to extend the package.

Besides the most basic R object types (vectors, matrices, tables or data frames), list-support might be interesting for you:

```rout
> pander(list(a = 1, b = 2, c = table(mtcars$am), x = list(myname = 1, 2), 56))
<%=pander(list(a = 1, b = 2, c = table(mtcars$am), x = list(myname = 1, 2), 56))%>
```

A nested list can be seen above with a table and all (optional) list names. As a matter of fact, `pander.list` is the default method of `pander` too, when you call it on an unsupported R object class:

```rout
> x <- chisq.test(table(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear))
> class(x) <- "I've never heard of!"
> pander(x)
<%=
x <- chisq.test(table(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear))
class(x) <- 'I\'ve never heard of!'
x
%>
```

So `pander` showed a not known class in an (almost) user-friendly way. And we got some warnings too styled with [Pandoc **footnote**](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#footnotes)! If that document is exported to e.g. `HTML` or `pdf`, then the error/warning message could be found on the bottom of the page with a link. *Note*: there were two warnings in the above call - both captured and returned! Well, this is the feature of `Pandoc.brew`, see [below](#brew-to-pandoc).

But the output of different **statistical methods** are tried to be prettyfied. Some the above call normally returns like:

```rout
> pander(chisq.test(table(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear)))
<%= chisq.test(table(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear)) %>
```

A few other examples on the supported R classes:

```rout
> pander(t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep))
<%=t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep)%>

> ## Dobson (1990) Page 93: Randomized Controlled Trial (examples from: ?glm)
> counts <- c(18, 17, 15, 20, 10, 20, 25, 13, 12)
> outcome <- gl(3, 1, 9)
> treatment <- gl(3, 3)
> m <- glm(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poisson())
> pander(m)
<%=
counts <- c(18, 17, 15, 20, 10, 20, 25, 13, 12)
outcome <- gl(3, 1, 9)
treatment <- gl(3, 3)
m <- glm(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poisson())
m
%>

> pander(anova(m))
<%=anova(m)%>

> pander(aov(m))
<%=aov(m)%>

> pander(prcomp(USArrests))
<%=prcomp(USArrests)%>

> pander(density(mtcars$hp))
<%=density(mtcars$hp)%>

> ## Don't like scientific notation?
> panderOptions('round', 2)
> pander(density(mtcars$hp))
<%
panderOptions('round', 2)
pander(density(mtcars$hp))
panderOptions('round', Inf)
%>
```

And of course tables are formatted (e.g. auto add of line breaks, splitting up tables, hyphenation support or markdown format) based on the user specified [`panderOptions`](#pander-options).

# Creating Pandoc documents

The package is also capable of creating complex Pandoc documents (reports) from **R objects** in multiple ways:

  * create somehow a markdown text file (e.g. with `brew`, `knitr` or any scripts of yours, maybe with `Pandoc.brew` - see just [below](#brew-to-pandoc)) and transform that to other formats (like HTML, odt, PDF, docx etc.) with `Pandoc.convert` - similarly to [`pandoc` function in knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/pandoc/). Basically this is a wrapper around a [Pandoc](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) call, which has not much to do with R actually.

  * users might write some reports with literate programming (similar to `knitr`) in a forked version of [brew](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brew) syntax resulting. This means that the user can include R code chunks in a document, and brewing that results in a pretty Pandoc's markdown document and also in a **bunch of other formats** (like HTML, odt, PDF, docx etc.). The great advantage of this [function](#brew-to-pandoc) is that you do not have to transform your R objects to markdown manually, it's all handled automagically.

    *Example*: this [`README.md`](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/README.md) is cooked with [`Pandoc.brew`](#brew-to-pandoc) based on [`inst/README.brew`](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/README.brew) and also exported to [HTML](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/). Details can be found [below](#brew-to-pandoc) or head directly to [examples](#examples).

<!-- endlist -->

 * and users might create a report in a live R session by adding some R objects and paragraphs to a `Pandoc` reference class object. Details can be found [below](#live-report-generation).

## Brew to Pandoc

The [brew](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brew) package, which is a templating framework for report generation, has not been updated on CRAN since 2011, but it's still used in bunch of R projects based on its simple design and useful features in literate programming. For a quick overview, please see the following documents if you are not familiar with `brew`:

  * [slides on "Building a reporting sytem with BREW"](https://www.slideshare.net/xavierguardiola/building-a-reporting-sytem-with-brew)
  * [learnr blogpost on brew](https://learnr.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/brew-creating-repetitive-reports/)

**In short**: a `brew` document is a simple text file with some special tags. `Pandoc.brew` uses only two of them (as building on a personalized version of Jeff's really great `brew` function):

  * `<<%= '%' %> ... <%= '%' %>>` stand for running inline R commands as usual,
  * `<<%= '%' %>= ... <%= '%' %>>` does pretty much the same but applies `pander` to the returning R object (instead of `cat` like the original `brew` function does). So putting there any R object, it would return in a nice Pandoc's markdown format with all possible error/warning messages etc.

This latter tries to be smart in some ways:

  * A code chunk block (R commands between the tags) can return any number of values at any part of the block.
  * Plots and images are grabbed in the document, rendered to a `png` file and `pander` method would result in a Pandoc markdown formatted image link. This means that the image would be rendered/shown/included in the exported document.
  * All warnings/messages and errors are recorded in the blocks and returned in the document as footnotes or inline messages.
  * All heavy R commands (e.g. those taking more then 0.1 sec to evaluate) are [**cached**](#caching) so re`brew`ing a report would not result in a coffee break.

Besides this, the custom `brew` function can do more and also less compared to the original [`brew` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brew). First of all, the internal caching mechanism of `brew` has been removed and rewritten for some extra profits besides improved caching.

For example now multiple R expressions can be passed between the `<<%= '%' %>= ... <%= '%' %>>` tags, and not only the text results, but **the evaluated R objects** are also (invisibly) returned in a structured list. This can be really useful while post-processing the results of `brew`. Quick example:

```rout
> str(Pandoc.brew(text ='
+   Pi equals to `<<%= '%' %>= pi <%= '%' %>>`.
+   And here are some random data:
+   `<<%= '%' %>= runif(10) <%= '%' %>>`
+ '))

Pi equals to _3.142_.
And here are some random data:
_0.6631_, _0.849_, _0.06986_, _0.3343_, _0.5209_, _0.3471_, _0.866_, _0.05548_, _0.8933_ and _0.2121_

```

This document was generated by `Pandoc.brew` based on [`inst/README.brew`](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/README.brew) so the above examples were generated automatically by running:

```r
Pandoc.brew(system.file('README.brew', package = 'pander'))
```

The output is set to `stdout` by default, which means that the resulting text is written to the R console. But setting the `output` to a text file and running Pandoc on that to create a `HTML`, `odt`, `docx` or other document in one go is also possible. To export a brewed file to other then Pandoc's markdown, please use the `convert` parameter. For example:

```r
text <- paste('# Header',
              '',
              'What a lovely list:\n<<%= '%' %>= as.list(runif(10)) <%= '%' %>>',
              'A wide table:\n<<%= '%' %>= mtcars[1:3, ] <%= '%' %>>',
              'And a nice chart:\n\n<<%= '%' %>= plot(1:10) <%= '%' %>>',
          sep = '\n')
Pandoc.brew(text = text, output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')
Pandoc.brew(text = text, output = tempfile(), convert = 'pdf')
```

So to brew this README with all R chunks automatically converted to html, please run:

```r
Pandoc.brew(system.file('README.brew', package='pander'), output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')
```

### Examples

The package bundles some examples for `Pandoc.brew` to let you check its features pretty fast. These are:

  * [minimal.brew](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/examples/minimal.brew)
  * [short-code-long-report.brew](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/examples/short-code-long-report.brew)
  * [graphs.brew](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/examples/graphs.brew)

To `brew` these examples on your machine, try to run the followings commands:

```r
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/minimal.brew', package='pander'))
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/minimal.brew', package='pander'), output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')

Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/short-code-long-report.brew', package='pander'))
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/short-code-long-report.brew', package='pander'), output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')

Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/graphs.brew', package='pander'))
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/graphs.brew', package='pander'), output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')
```

For easier access, I have uploaded some exported documents of the above examples as well:

  * minimal.brew: [markdown](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/minimal.md) [html](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/minimal.html) [pdf](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/minimal.pdf) [odt](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/minimal.odt) [docx](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/minimal.docx)

Please check out `pdf`, `docx`, `odt` and other formats by changing the above `convert` option on your machine, and do not forget to [give some feedback](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues)!

## Live report generation

`pander` package has a special reference class called `Pandoc` which could collect some blocks in a live R session and export the whole document to Pandoc/PDF/HTML etc. Without any serious further explanations, please check out the below (self-commenting) example:

```r
## Initialize a new Pandoc object
myReport <- Pandoc$new()

## Add author, title and date of document
myReport$author <- 'Gergely DarÃ³czi'
myReport$title  <- 'Demo'

## Or it could be done while initializing
myReport <- Pandoc$new('Gergely DarÃ³czi', 'Demo')

## Add some free text
myReport$add.paragraph('Hello there, this is a really short tutorial!')

## Add maybe a header for later stuff
myReport$add.paragraph('# Showing some raw R objects below')

## Adding a short matrix
myReport$add(matrix(5,5,5))

## Or a table with even
myReport$add.paragraph('Hello table:')
myReport$add(table(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear))

## Or a "large" data frame which barely fits on a page
myReport$add(mtcars)

## And a simple linear model with Anova tables
ml <- with(lm(mpg ~ hp + wt), data = mtcars)
myReport$add(ml)
myReport$add(anova(ml))
myReport$add(aov(ml))

## And do some principal component analysis at last
myReport$add(prcomp(USArrests))

## Sorry, I did not show how Pandoc deals with plots:
myReport$add(plot(1:10))

## Want to see the report? Just print it:
myReport

## Exporting to PDF (default)
myReport$export()

## Or to docx in tempdir():
myReport$format <- 'docx'
myReport$export(tempfile())

## You do not want to see the generated report after generation?
myReport$export(open = FALSE)
```

# Capturing evaluation information with evals

When working on the [rapport package](https://rapporter.github.io/rapport/), I really needed some nifty R function that can evaluate R expression along with capturing errors and warnings. Unfortunately the `evaluate` package had only limited features at that time, as it could not return the raw R object, but only the standard output with messages. So I wrote my own function, and soon some further feature requests arose, like identifying if an R expression results in a plot etc. This section aims to give a quick introduction to the functionality of `evals`, but for more usage/implementation details, please refer to specialized vignette, which can be accessed by `vignette('evals', package='pander')` or available online [here](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/evals.html).


But probably it's easier to explain what `evals` can do with a simple example:

```rout
> evals('1:10')
<%= paste(capture.output(evals('1:10')), collapse = '\n') %>
```

So `evals` can evaluate a character vector of R expressions, and it returns a list of captured stuff while running those:

 * `src` holds the R expression,
 * `result` contains the raw R object as is,
 * `output` represents how the R object is printed to the standard output,
 * `type` is the `class` of the returned R object,
 * `msg` is a list of possible messages captured while running the R expression and
 * `stdout` contains if anything was written to the standard output.

Besides capturing this nifty list of important circumstances, `evals` can automatically identify if an R expression is returning anything to a graphical device, and can save the resulting image in a variety of file formats along with some extra options, like applying a custom theme on base, `lattice` or `ggplot2` plots:

```rout
> evals('hist(mtcars$hp)')[[1]]$result
<%= evals('hist(mtcars$hp)')[[1]]$result %>
```

So instead of a captured R object (which would be `NULL` in this situation by the way), we get the path of the image where the plot was saved:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rapporter/pander/gh-pages/plots/graphs-1.png)

Well, this is not a standard histogram usually returned by the `hist` function, right? As mentioned before, `evals` have some extra features like applying the user defined theme on various plots automatically. Please see the `graphs.brew` example [above](#examples) for further details, or check the related [global options](#evals-options). If you do not like this feature, simply add `evalsOptions('graph.unify`, FALSE)` to your `.Rprofile`.


Further features are described in the [technical docs](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pander/functions/evals), and now I'll only give a brief introduction to another important feature of `evals`.

## Caching

As `pander::evals` is using a **custom caching algorithm** in the means of evaluating R expressions, it might be worthwhile to give a short summary of what is going on in the background when you are running e.g. [`Pandoc.brew`](#brew-to-pandoc), the ["live report generation"](#live-report-generation) engine or `evals` directly:

  * Each passed R chunk is `parse`d to single R expressions.
  * Each parsed expression's **part** (let it be a function, variable, constant etc.) is evaluated (as `name`) separately to a `list`. This list describes the unique structure *and* the content of the passed R expressions. This has some really great benefits (see below).
  * A **hash** is computed of each list element and *cached* too in `pander`'s local environments. This is useful if you are using large data frames, just imagine: the caching algorithm would have to compute the hash for the same data frame each time it's touched! This way the hash is recomputed only if the R object with the given name is changed.
  * The list of such R objects is serialized, then an `SHA-1` hash is computed, which is unique and there is no real risk of collision.
  * If [`evals`](#evals) can find the cached results in an environment of `pander`'s namespace (if `cache.mode` set to `enviroment` - see [below](#pander-options)) or in a file named to the computed hash (if `Ä‹ache.mode` set to `disk`), then it is returned on the spot. *The objects modified/created by the cached code are also updated.*
  * Otherwise the call is evaluated and the results and the modified R objects of the environment are optionally saved to cache (e.g. if `cache` is active *and* if the `proc.time()` of the evaluation is higher then it is defined in `cache.time` - see details in [evals' options](#evals-options)).

<a id="in-practice"></a>

As `pander` does not cache based on raw sources of chunks and there is no easy way of enabling/disabling caching on a chunk basis, the users have to live with some *great advantages* and some *minor tricky situations* - which latter cannot be solved theoretically in my opinion, but [I'd love to hear your feedback](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues).

The caching hash is computed based on the structure and **content** of the R commands instead of the used variable names or R expressions, so let us make some POC example to show the **greatest asset**:

```r
x <- mtcars$hp
y <- 1e3
evals('sapply(rep(x, y), mean)')
```

It took a while, huh? :)

Let us create some custom functions and variables, which are not identical to the above call:

```r
f <- sapply
g <- rep
h <- mean
X <- mtcars$hp * 1
Y <- 1000
```

And now try to run something like:

```r
evals('f(g(X, Y), h)')
```

Yes, it was returned from cache!

About the **kickback**:

As `pander` (or rather: `evals`) does not really deal with what is written in the provided sources but rather checks what is **inside that**, there might be some tricky situations where you would expect the cache to work, but it would not. Short example: we are computing and saving to a variable something heavy in a chunk (please run these in a clean R session to avoid conflicts):

```r
evals('x <- sapply(rep(mtcars$hp, 1e3), mean)')
```

It is cached, just run again, you will see.

But if you would create `x` in your *global environment* with any value (which has nothing to do with the special environment of the report!) **and** `x` was not defined in the report before this call (**and** you had no `x` value in your global environment before), then the content of `x` would result in a new hash for the cache - so caching would not work. E.g.:

```r
x <- 'foobar'
evals('x <- sapply(rep(mtcars$hp, 1e3), mean)')
```

I really think this is a minor issue (with very special coincidences) which cannot be addressed cleverly - but **could be avoided with some cautions** (e.g. run `Pandoc.brew` in a clean R session like with `Rscript` or [`littler`](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/littler.html) - if you are really afraid of this issue). And after all: you loose nothing, just the cache would not work for that only line and only once in most of the cases.

Other cases when the hash of a call will not match cached hashes:

  * a number is replaced by a variable holding the number, e.g.: `evals('1:5')` vs. `x <- 1:5;evals('x')`
  * a part of an R object is replaced by a variable holding that, e.g.: `evals('mean(mtcars$hp)')` vs. `x <- mtcars$hp;evals('mean(x)')`

But the e.g. following do work from cache fine:

```
x  <- mtcars$hp
xx <- mtcars$hp*1
evals('mean(x)')
evals('mean(xx)')
```

# General options

The package comes with a variety of globally adjustable options, which have an effect on the result of your reports. You can query and update these options with the `panderOptions` function:

  * `digits`: numeric (default: `2`) passed to `format`.  Can be a vector specifying values for each column (has to be the same length as number of columns). Values for non-numeric columns will be disregarded.
  * `decimal.mark`: string (default: `.`) passed to `format`
  * `formula.caption.prefix`: string (default: `Formula: `) passed to `pandoc.formula` to be used as caption prefix. Be sure about what you are doing if changing to other than `Formula: ` or `:`.
  * `big.mark`: string (default: ``) passed to `format`
  * `round`: numeric (default: `Inf`) passed to `round`. Can be a vector specifying values for each column (has to be the same length as number of columns). Values for non-numeric columns will be disregarded.
  * `keep.trailing.zeros`: boolean (default: `FALSE`) show or remove trailing zeros in numbers (e.g. in numeric vectors or in columns of tables with numeric values)
  * `keep.line.breaks`: boolean (default: `FALSE`) to keep or remove line breaks from cells in a table
  * `missing`: string (default: `NA`) to replace missing values in vectors, tables etc.
  * `date`: string (default: `'%Y/%m/%d %X'`) passed to `format` when printing dates (`POSIXct` or `POSIXt`)
  * `header.style`: `'atx'` or `'setext'` passed to `pandoc.header`
  * `list.style`: `'bullet'` (default), `'ordered'` or `'roman'` passed to `pandoc.list`. Please not that this has no effect on `pander` methods.
  * `table.style`: `'multiline'`, `'grid'` or `'simple'` passed to `pandoc.table`
  * `table.emphasize.rownames`: boolean (default: `TRUE`) if row names should be highlighted
  * `table.split.table`: numeric passed to `pandoc.table` and also affects `pander` methods. This option tells `pander` where to split too wide tables. The default value (`80`) suggests the conventional number of characters used in a line, feel free to change (e.g. to `Inf` to disable this feature) if you are not using a VT100 terminal any more :)
  * `table.split.cells`: numeric (default: 30) passed to `pandoc.table` and also affects pander methods. This option tells pander where to split too wide cells with line breaks. Set `Inf`` to disable.
  * `table.caption.prefix`: string (default: `Table: `) passed to `pandoc.table` to be used as caption prefix. Be sure about what you are doing if changing to other than `Table: ` or `:`.
  * `table.continues`: string (default: `Table continues below`) passed to `pandoc.table` to be used as caption for long (split) without a use defined caption
  * `table.continues.affix`: string (default: `(continued below)`) passed to `pandoc.table` to be used as an affix concatenated to the user defined caption for long (split) tables
  * `table.alignment.default`: string (default: `centre`) that defines the default alignment of cells. Can be `left`, `right` or `centre` that latter can be also spelled as `center`
  * `table.alignment.rownames`: string (default: `centre`) that defines the alignment of rownames in tables. Can be `left`, `right` or `centre` that latter can be also spelled as `center`
  * `use.hyphening`: boolean (default: `FALSE`) if try to use hyphening when splitting large cells according to table.split.cells. Requires `sylly` package.
  * `evals.messages`: boolean (default: `TRUE`) passed to `evals`' `pander` method specifying if messages should be rendered
  * `p.wrap`: a string (default:`'_'`) to wrap vector elements passed to `p` function
  * `p.sep`: a string (default: `', '`) with the main separator passed to `p` function
  * `p.copula`: a string (default: `'and'`) a string with ending separator passed to `p` function
  * `plain.ascii`: boolean (default: FALSE) to define if output should be in plain ascii or not
  * `graph.nomargin`: boolean (default: `TRUE`) if trying to keep plots' margins at minimal
  * `graph.fontfamily`: string (default: `'sans'`) specifying the font family to be used in images. Please note, that using a custom font on Windows requires `grDevices:::windowsFonts` first.
  * `graph.fontcolor`: string (default: `'black'`) specifying the default font color
  * `graph.fontsize`: numeric (default: `12`) specifying the *base* font size in pixels. Main title is rendered with `1.2` and labels with `0.8` multiplier.
  * `graph.grid`: boolean (default: `TRUE`) if a grid should be added to the plot
  * `graph.grid.minor`: boolean (default: `TRUE`) if a miner grid should be also rendered
  * `graph.grid.color`: string (default: `'grey'`) specifying the color of the rendered grid
  * `graph.grid.lty`: string (default: `'dashed'`) specifying the line type of grid
  * `graph.boxes`: boolean (default: `FALSE`) if to render a border around of plot (and e.g. around strip)
  * `graph.legend.position`: string (default: `'right'`) specifying the position of the legend: 'top', 'right', 'bottom' or 'left'
  * `graph.background`: string (default: `'white'`) specifying the plots main background's color
  * `graph.panel.background`: string (default: `'transparent'`) specifying the plot's main panel background. Please *note*, that this option is not supported with `base` graphics.
  * `graph.colors`: character vector of default color palette (defaults to a [colorblind theme](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/)). Please *note* that this update work with `base` plots by appending the `col` argument to the call if not set.
  * `graph.color.rnd`: boolean (default: `FALSE`) specifying if the palette should be reordered randomly before rendering each plot to get colorful images
  * `graph.axis.angle`: numeric (default: `1`) specifying the angle of axes' labels. The available options are based on `par(les)` and sets if the labels should be:

      *  `1`: parallel to the axis,
      *  `2`: horizontal,
      *  `3`: perpendicular to the axis or
      *  `4`: vertical.

  * `graph.symbol`: numeric (default: `1`) specifying a symbol (see the `pch` parameter of `par`)
  * `knitr.auto.asis`: boolean (default: `TRUE`) if the results of `pander` should be considered as `asis` in `knitr`. Equals to specifying `results='asis'` in the R chunk, so thus there is no need to do so if set to `TRUE`.

<a id='evals-options'></a><a id='evalsoptions'></a>

Besides localization of numeric formats or the styles of tables, lists and plots, there are some technical options as well, which would effect e.g. [caching](#caching) or the format of rendered image files. You can query/update those with the `evalsOptions` function as the main backend of `pander` calls is a custom evaluation function called [`evals`](#evals).

The list of possible options are:

  * `parse`: if `TRUE` the provided `txt` elements would be merged into one string and parsed to logical chunks. This is useful if you would want to get separate results of your code parts - not just the last returned value, but you are passing the whole script in one string. To manually lock lines to each other (e.g. calling a `plot` and on next line adding an `abline` or `text` to it), use a plus char (`+`) at the beginning of each line which should be evaluated with the previous one(s). If set to `FALSE`, [`evals`](#evals) would not try to parse R code, it would get evaluated in separate runs - as provided. Please see the documentation of [`evals`](#evals).
  * `cache`: [caching](#caching) the result of R calls if set to `TRUE`
  * `cache.mode`: cached results could be stored in an `environment` in _current_ R session or let it be permanent on `disk`.
  * `cache.dir`: path to a directory holding cache files if `cache.mode` set to `disk`. Default set to `.cache` in current working directory.
  * `cache.time`: number of seconds to limit caching based on `proc.time`. If set to `0`, all R commands, if set to `Inf`, none is cached (despite the `cache` parameter).
  * `cache.copy.images`: copy images to new file names if an image is returned from the *disk* cache? If set to `FALSE` (default), the cached path would be returned.
  * `classes`: a vector or list of classes which should be returned. If set to `NULL` (by default) all R objects will be returned.
  * `hooks`: list of hooks to be run for given classes in the form of `list(class = fn)`. If you would also specify some parameters of the function, a list should be provided in the form of `list(fn, param1, param2=NULL)` etc. So the hooks would become `list(class1=list(fn, param1, param2=NULL), ...)`. See example of [`evals`](#evals) for more details. A default hook can be specified too by setting the class to `'default'`. This can be handy if you do not want to define separate methods/functions to each possible class, but automatically apply the default hook to all classes not mentioned in the list. You may also specify only one element in the list like: `hooks=list('default' = pander_return)`. Please note, that nor error/warning messages, nor stdout is captured (so: updated) while running hooks!
  * `length`: any R object exceeding the specified length will not be returned. The default value (`Inf`) does not filter out any R objects.
  * `output`: a character vector of required returned values. This might be useful if you are only interested in the `result`, and do not want to save/see e.g. `messages` or `print`ed `output`. See examples of [`evals`](#evals).
  * `graph.unify`: should `evals` try to unify the style of (`base`, `lattice` and `ggplot2`) plots? If set to `TRUE`, some `panderOptions()` would apply. By default this is disabled not to freak out useRs :)
  * `graph.name`: set the file name of saved plots which is `%s` by default. A simple character string might be provided where `%d` would be replaced by the index of the generating `txt` source, `%n` with an incremented integer in `graph.dir` with similar file names and `%t` by some unique random characters. When used in a `brew` file, `%i` is also available which would be replaced by the chunk number.
  * `graph.dir`: path to a directory where to place generated images. If the directory does not exist, [`evals`](#evals) try to create that. Default set to `plots` in current working directory.
  * `graph.output`: set the required file format of saved plots. Currently it could be any of  `grDevices`: `png`, `bmp`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `tiff`, `svg` or `pdf`. Set to `NA` not to save plots at all and tweak that setting with `capture.plot()` on demand.
  * `width`: width of generated plot in pixels for even vector formats
  * `height`: height of generated plot in pixels for even vector formats
  * `res`: nominal resolution in `ppi`. The height and width of vector images will be calculated based in this.
  * `hi.res`: generate high resolution plots also? If set to `TRUE`, each R code parts resulting an image would be run twice.
  * `hi.res.width`: width of generated high resolution plot in pixels for even vector formats. The `height` and `res` of high resolution image is automatically computed based on the above options to preserve original plot aspect ratio.
  * `graph.env`: save the environments in which plots were generated to distinct files (based on `graph.name`) with `env` extension?
  * `graph.recordplot`: save the plot via `recordPlot` to distinct files (based on `graph.name`) with `recodplot` extension?
  * `graph.RDS` save the raw R object returned (usually with `lattice` or `ggplot2`) while generating the plots to distinct files (based on `graph.name`) with `RDS` extension?
  * `log`: `NULL` or an optionally passed *namespace* for `logger` to record all info, trace, debug and error messages.

# Difference from other rendering packages

How does `pander` differ from Sweave, brew, knitr, R2HTML and the other tools of literate programming? First of all `pander` can be used as a helper with any other literate programming solution, so **you can call `pander` inside of `knitr` chunks**.


But if you stick with `pander`'s literate programming engine, then there's not much need for calling `ascii`, `xtable`, `Hmisc`, `tables` etc. or even `pander` in the R command chunks to **transform R objects** into markdown, HTML, tex etc. as `Pandoc.brew` automatically results in Pandoc's markdown, which can be converted to almost any text document format. Conversion can be done automatically after calling `pander` reporting functions ([Pander.brew](#brew-to-pandoc) or [Pandoc](#live-report-generation)).

Based on the fact that `pander` transforms R objects into markdown, **no "traditional" R console output is shown** in the resulting document (nor in markdown, nor in exported docs), but **all R objects are transformed to tables, list etc**. Well, there is an option (`show.src`) to show the original R commands before the formatted output, and `pander` calls can be also easily tweaked to return the printed version of the R objects - if you would need that in some strange situation - like writing an R tutorial. But  really think that nor R code, nor raw R results have anything to do with an exported report.

Of course **all warnings, messages and errors are captured** while evaluating R expressions just like `stdout` besides the **raw R objects**. So the resulting report also includes the raw R objects for further edits if needed - which is a very unique feature.

**Graphs and plots are automatically identified** in code chunks and saved to disk in a `png` file linked in the resulting document. This means that if you create a report (e.g. `brew` a text file) and export it to PDF/docx etc. all the plots/images would be there. There are some parameters to specify the resolution of the image and also the type (e.g. `jpg`, `svg` or `pdf`) besides a **wide variety of [theme options](#pander-options)**. About the latter, please check the `graphs.brew` example [above](#examples).

And `pander` uses its built-in (IMHO quite decent) [**caching**](#caching) engine. This means that if the evaluation of some R commands takes too long time (which can be set by option/parameter), then the results are saved in a file and returned from there on next similar R code's evaluation. This caching algorithm tries to be smart, as it not only  checks the passed R sources, but the content of all variables and functions, and saves the hash of those. This is a quite secure way of caching (see details [above](#caching)), but if you would encounter any issues, just switch off the cache. I've not seen any issues for years :)

# ESS

I have created some simple LISP functions which would be handy if you are using the best damn IDE for R. These functions and default key-bindings are [shipped with the package](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/pander.el), feel free to personalize.

As time passed these small functions grew heavier (with my Emacs knowledge) so I ended up with a small library:

## pander-mode

I am currently working on `pander-mode` which is a small *minor-mode* for Emacs. There are a few (but useful) functions with default keybindings:

  * `pander-brew` (`C-c p b`): Run `Pandoc.brew` on current buffer or region (if mark is active), show results in *ess-output* and (optionally) copy results to clipboard while setting working directory to `tempdir()` temporary.
  * `pander-brew-export` (`C-c p B`): Run `Pandoc.brew` on current buffer or region (if mark is active) and export results to specified (auto-complete in minibuffer) format. Also tries to open exported document.
  * `pander-eval` (`C-c p e`): Run `pander` on (automatically evaluated) region *or* current chunk (if marker is not set), show results (of last returned R object) in `*ess-output*` and (optionally) copy those to clipboard while setting working directory to `tempdir()` temporary.

Few options of `pander-mode`: `M-x customize-group pander`

  * `pander-clipboard`: If non-nil then the result of `pander-*` functions would be copied to clipboard.
  * `pander-show-source`: If non-nil then the source of R commands would also show up in generated documents while running 'pander-eval'. This would not affect `brew` functions ATM.

To use this small lib, just type: `M-x pander-mode` on any document. It might be useful to add a hook to `markdown-mode` if you find this useful.

`evals` is aimed at collecting as much information as possible while evaluating R code. It can evaluate a character vector of R expressions, and it returns a list of information captured while running them:

* `src` holds the R expression,
* `result` contains the raw R object as-is,
* `output` represents how the R object is printed to the standard output,
* `type` is the class of the returned R object,
* `msg` is a list of messages captured while evaluating the R expression. Among other messages, warnings/errors will appear here.
* `stdout` contains what, if anything, was written to the standard output.

Besides capturing evaluation information, `evals` is able to automatically identify whether an R expression is returning anything to a graphical device, and can save the resulting image in a variety of file formats.

Another interesting `evals` feature is caching the results of evaluated expressions. Read the [caching](#result-caching) section for more details.

`evals` has a large number of options, which allow users to customize the call exactly as needed. Here we will focus on the most useful features, but the full list of options, with explanations, can be viewed by calling `?evalsOptions`. Also `evals` support permanent options that will persist for all calls to `evals`, this can be achieved by calling `evalsOptions`.

Let's start with a basic example by evaluating `1:10` and collecting all information about it:

```{r}
evals('1:10')
```

Not all the information might be useful, so `evals` makes it is possible to capture only some of the information, by specifying the `output` parameter:

```{r}
evals('1:10', output = c('result', 'output'))
```

One of the neat features of `evals` that it catches errors/warnings without interrupting the evaluation and saves them.

```{r}
evals('x')[[1]]$msg
evals('as.numeric("1.1a")')[[1]]$msg
```

## Graphs and Graphical Options

As mentioned before, `evals` captures the output to graphical devices and saves it:

```{r}
evals('plot(mtcars)')[[1]]$result
```

![](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/plots/evals-mtcars.jpeg)

You can specify the output directory using the `graph.dir` parameter, and the output type using the `graph.output` parameter. Currently, it could be any of `grDevices`: `png`, `bmp`,` jpeg`,` jpg`, `tiff`, `svg`,  or `pdf`.

```{r}
evals('plot(mtcars)', graph.dir = 'my_plots', graph.output = 'jpg')[[1]]$result
```

Moreover, `evals` provides facilities to:

* save the environments in which plots were generated
* save the plot via `recordPlot` to distinct files with `recodplot` extension
* save the raw R object returned (usually with `lattice` or `ggplot2`) while generating the plot to distinct files with `RDS` extension

### Style unification

`evals` provides very powerful facilities to unify the styling of images produced by different packages, like `ggplot2` and `lattice`.

Let's prepare the data for plotting:

```{r}
## generating dataset
set.seed(1)
df <- mtcars[, c('hp', 'wt')]
df$factor <- sample(c('Foo', 'Bar', 'Foo bar'), size = nrow(df), replace = TRUE)
df$factor2 <- sample(c('Foo', 'Bar', 'Foo bar'), size = nrow(df), replace = TRUE)
df$time <- 1:nrow(df)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
## loading packages
require(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
require(lattice, quietly = TRUE)
```

Now let's plot the histograms:

```{r}
evalsOptions('graph.unify', TRUE)
evals('histogram(df$hp, main = "Histogram with lattice")')[[1]]$result
evals('ggplot(df) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hp), binwidth = 50) + ggtitle("Histogram with ggplot2")')[[1]]$result
evalsOptions('graph.unify', FALSE)
```

![](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/plots/evals-lattice.jpeg)
![](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/plots/evals-ggplot2.jpeg)

Options for unification can be set with `panderOptions`. For example:

```r
panderOptions('graph.fontfamily', "Comic Sans MS")
panderOptions('graph.fontsize', 18)
panderOptions('graph.fontcolor', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.grid.color', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.axis.angle', 3)
panderOptions('graph.boxes', T)
panderOptions('graph.legend.position', 'top')
panderOptions('graph.colors', rainbow(5))
panderOptions('graph.grid', FALSE)
panderOptions('graph.symbol', 22)
```

More information and examples on style unification can be obtained by `Pandoc.brew`ing the tutorial available [here](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/blob/master/inst/examples/graphs.brew).

## Logging

To make execution and debugging easier to understand, `evals` provides logging with the `log` parameter. Logging in `evals` relies on the [`logger`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=logger) package,  which provides a logging API similar to `log4j`. Basic example:

```{r}
x <- evals('1:10', log = 'foo')
```

`logger`'s thresholds range from most verbose to least verbose: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`. The threshold defaults to `INFO`, which will hide some unessential information. To permanently set the threshold for logger use `log_threshold`:

```{r}
evalsOptions('log', 'evals')
log_threshold(TRACE, namespace = 'evals')
x <- evals('1:10', cache.time = 0)
```

`logger` also provides a very useful ability to write logs to files instead of printing them to the prompt:

```{r}
t <- tempfile()
log_appender(appender_file(t), namespace = 'evals')
x <- evals('1:10', log = 'evals')
readLines(t)
# revert back to console
log_appender(appender_stdout, namespace = 'evals')
```

## Result Caching

`evals` is uses a custom caching algorithm to cache the results of evaluated R expressions.

### How it works

* All R code passed to `evals` is split into single expressions and parsed.
* For each R expression (function call, assignment, etc.), `evals` extracts symbols in a separate list in `getCallParts`. This list describes the unique structure and the content of the passed R expressions
* A hash is computed for each list element and cached in `pander`'s local environments. This is useful if you are using large data frames; otherwise, the caching algorithm would have to compute the hash for the same data frame each time it's touched! This way the hash is recomputed only if the R object with the given name is changed.
* The list of such R objects is serialized, then an SHA-1 hash is computed, taking into consideration `panderOptions` and `evalsOptions`, which all together is unique and there is no real risk of collision.
* If `evals` can find the cached results in the appropriate environment (if `cache.mode set` to environment) or in a file named to the computed hash (if `cache.mode` set to `disk`), then it is returned on the spot. The objects modified/created by the cached code are also updated.
* Otherwise the call is evaluated and the results and the modified R objects of the environment are optionally saved to cache (e.g. if `cache` is active and if the evaluation `proc.time()` > `cache.time` parameter). Cached results are saved in `cached.results` in `pander`'s namespace. `evals` also remembers if R expressions change the evaluation environment (for example assignments) and saves such changes in `cached.environemnts` in `pander`'s namespace.

### Examples

We will set `cache.time` to 0, to cache all expressions regardless of time they took to evaluate. We will also use the logging facilites described above to simplify the understanding of how caching works.

```{r}
evalsOptions('cache.time', 0)
evalsOptions('log', 'evals')
log_threshold(TRACE, 'evals')
```

Let's start with small example.

```{r}
system.time(evals('1:1e5'))
system.time(evals('1:1e5'))
```

Results cached by `evals` can be stored in an *environment* in current `R` session or permanently on disk by setting the `cache.mode` parameter appropriately.

```{r}
res <- evals('1:1e5', cache.mode = 'disk', cache.dir = 'cachedir')
list.files('cachedir')
```

Since the hash for caching is computed based on the *structure* and *content* of the R commands, instead of the  variable names or R expressions, `evals` is able to achieve great results:

```{r}
x <- mtcars$hp
y <- 1e3
system.time(evals('sapply(rep(x, y), mean)'))
```

Let us create some custom functions and variables, which are not identical to the above call:

```{r}
f <- sapply
g <- rep
h <- mean
X <- mtcars$hp * 1
Y <- 1000
system.time(evals('f(g(X, Y), h)'))
```

Another important feature of `evals` is that it notes changes in the evaluation environment. For example:

```{r}
x <- 1
res <- evals('x <- 1:10;')
```

`x <- 1:10` will be cached; if the same assignment occurs again we won't need to evaluate it. But what about the change of `x` when we get the result from the cache? `evals` takes care of that.

So in the following example we can see that `x <- 1:10` is not evaluated, but retrieved from cache with the change to `x` in the environment.

```{r}
evals('x <- 1:10; x[3]')[[2]]$result
```

Also `evals` is able to cache output to graphical devices produced during evaluation:

```{r}
system.time(evals('plot(mtcars)'))
system.time(evals('plot(mtcars)'))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
unlink('cachedir', recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
unlink('my_plots', recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Capturing evaluation information with
evals</h1>
<h4 class="author">Roman Tsegelskyi, Gergely DarÃ³czi</h4>
<h4 class="date">2022-03-18</h4>



<p><code>evals</code> is aimed at collecting as much information as
possible while evaluating R code. It can evaluate a character vector of
R expressions, and it returns a list of information captured while
running them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src</code> holds the R expression,</li>
<li><code>result</code> contains the raw R object as-is,</li>
<li><code>output</code> represents how the R object is printed to the
standard output,</li>
<li><code>type</code> is the class of the returned R object,</li>
<li><code>msg</code> is a list of messages captured while evaluating the
R expression. Among other messages, warnings/errors will appear
here.</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> contains what, if anything, was written to the
standard output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides capturing evaluation information, <code>evals</code> is able
to automatically identify whether an R expression is returning anything
to a graphical device, and can save the resulting image in a variety of
file formats.</p>
<p>Another interesting <code>evals</code> feature is caching the results
of evaluated expressions. Read the <a href="#result-caching">caching</a>
section for more details.</p>
<p><code>evals</code> has a large number of options, which allow users
to customize the call exactly as needed. Here we will focus on the most
useful features, but the full list of options, with explanations, can be
viewed by calling <code>?evalsOptions</code>. Also <code>evals</code>
support permanent options that will persist for all calls to
<code>evals</code>, this can be achieved by calling
<code>evalsOptions</code>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s start with a basic example by evaluating <code>1:10</code> and
collecting all information about it:</p>

<p>Not all the information might be useful, so <code>evals</code> makes
it is possible to capture only some of the information, by specifying
the <code>output</code> parameter:</p>

<p>You can specify the output directory using the <code>graph.dir</code>
parameter, and the output type using the <code>graph.output</code>
parameter. Currently, it could be any of <code>grDevices</code>:
<code>png</code>, <code>bmp</code>,<code>jpeg</code>,<code>jpg</code>,
<code>tiff</code>, <code>svg</code>, or <code>pdf</code>.</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>evals</code> provides facilities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>save the environments in which plots were generated</li>
<li>save the plot via <code>recordPlot</code> to distinct files with
<code>recodplot</code> extension</li>
<li>save the raw R object returned (usually with <code>lattice</code> or
<code>ggplot2</code>) while generating the plot to distinct files with
<code>RDS</code> extension</li>
</ul>
<div id="style-unification" class="section level3">
<h3>Style unification</h3>
<p><code>evals</code> provides very powerful facilities to unify the
styling of images produced by different packages, like
<code>ggplot2</code> and <code>lattice</code>.</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>To make execution and debugging easier to understand,
<code>evals</code> provides logging with the <code>log</code> parameter.
Logging in <code>evals</code> relies on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=logger"><code>logger</code></a>
package, which provides a logging API similar to <code>log4j</code>.
Basic example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">evals</span>(<span class="st">&#39;1:10&#39;</span>, <span class="at">log =</span> <span class="st">&#39;foo&#39;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>logger</code>â€™s thresholds range from most verbose to least
verbose: <code>TRACE</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>,
<code>WARN</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>FATAL</code>. The threshold
defaults to <code>INFO</code>, which will hide some unessential
information. To permanently set the threshold for logger use
<code>log_threshold</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">evalsOptions</span>(<span class="st">&#39;log&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;evals&#39;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">log_threshold</span>(TRACE, <span class="at">namespace =</span> <span class="st">&#39;evals&#39;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">evals</span>(<span class="st">&#39;1:10&#39;</span>, <span class="at">cache.time =</span> <span class="dv">0</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>logger</code> also provides a very useful ability to write logs
to files instead of printing them to the prompt:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>t <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">tempfile</span>()</span>

<div id="result-caching" class="section level2">
<h2>Result Caching</h2>
<p><code>evals</code> is uses a custom caching algorithm to cache the
results of evaluated R expressions.</p>
<div id="how-it-works" class="section level3">
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>All R code passed to <code>evals</code> is split into single
expressions and parsed.</li>
<li>For each R expression (function call, assignment, etc.),
<code>evals</code> extracts symbols in a separate list in
<code>getCallParts</code>. This list describes the unique structure and
the content of the passed R expressions</li>
<li>A hash is computed for each list element and cached in
<code>pander</code>â€™s local environments. This is useful if you are
using large data frames; otherwise, the caching algorithm would have to
compute the hash for the same data frame each time itâ€™s touched! This
way the hash is recomputed only if the R object with the given name is
changed.</li>
<li>The list of such R objects is serialized, then an SHA-1 hash is
computed, taking into consideration <code>panderOptions</code> and
<code>evalsOptions</code>, which all together is unique and there is no
real risk of collision.</li>
<li>If <code>evals</code> can find the cached results in the appropriate
environment (if <code>cache.mode set</code> to environment) or in a file
named to the computed hash (if <code>cache.mode</code> set to
<code>disk</code>), then it is returned on the spot. The objects
modified/created by the cached code are also updated.</li>
<li>Otherwise the call is evaluated and the results and the modified R
objects of the environment are optionally saved to cache (e.g.Â if
<code>cache</code> is active and if the evaluation
<code>proc.time()</code> &gt; <code>cache.time</code> parameter). Cached
results are saved in <code>cached.results</code> in
<code>pander</code>â€™s namespace. <code>evals</code> also remembers if R
expressions change the evaluation environment (for example assignments)
and saves such changes in <code>cached.environemnts</code> in
<code>pander</code>â€™s namespace.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="examples" class="section level3">
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>We will set <code>cache.time</code> to 0, to cache all expressions
regardless of time they took to evaluate. We will also use the logging
facilites described above to simplify the understanding of how caching
works.</p>

<p>Results cached by <code>evals</code> can be stored in an

<p>Since the hash for caching is computed based on the
<em>structure</em> and <em>content</em> of the R commands, instead of
the variable names or R expressions, <code>evals</code> is able to
achieve great results:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> mtcars<span class="sc">$</span>hp</span>

<p>Let us create some custom functions and variables, which are not
identical to the above call:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>f <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> sapply</span>

<p>Another important feature of <code>evals</code> is that it notes
changes in the evaluation environment. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="dv">1</span></span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>res <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">evals</span>(<span class="st">&#39;x &lt;- 1:10;&#39;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; INFO [2022-03-18 09:57:17] Command run: x &lt;- 1:10</span></span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; TRACE [2022-03-18 09:57:17] Cached result</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>x &lt;- 1:10</code> will be cached; if the same assignment
occurs again we wonâ€™t need to evaluate it. But what about the change of
<code>x</code> when we get the result from the cache? <code>evals</code>
takes care of that.</p>
<p>So in the following example we can see that <code>x &lt;- 1:10</code>
is not evaluated, but retrieved from cache with the change to
<code>x</code> in the environment.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">evals</span>(<span class="st">&#39;x &lt;- 1:10; x[3]&#39;</span>)[[<span class="dv">2</span>]]<span class="sc">$</span>result</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><a href="#cb18-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; INFO [2022-03-18 09:57:17] Command run: x &lt;- 1:10</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3"><a href="#cb18-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#&gt; TRACE [2022-03-18 09:57:17] Returning cached R object.</span></span>

library(pander)
library(knitr)
```

While the report generation functionality of `pander` and `knitr` do overlap, we feel that the most powerful way to use `R/knitr/pander` for report generation is to utilize them together. This short vignette aims to explain how to embed `pander` output in reports generated by `knitr`. If you are not aware of `knitr`, be sure to check out the project's [homepage](https://yihui.org/knitr/) for extensive documentation and examples.

One of `knitr`'s most useful features is the ability to convert tables to output format on the fly. For example:

```{r}
head(iris)
knitr::kable(head(iris))
```

However, `kable` table generator is simple by design, and does not capture all the variety of classes that `R` has to offer. For example, `CrossTable` and `tabular` are not supported:

```{r, error = TRUE}
library(descr, quietly = TRUE)
ct <- CrossTable(mtcars$gear, mtcars$cyl)
knitr::kable(ct)
library(tables, quietly = TRUE)
tab <- tabular( (Species + 1) ~ (n=1) + Format(digits=2)*
         (Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width)*(mean + sd), data=iris )
knitr::kable(tab)
```

This is where `pander` comes in handy, as `pander` supports rendering for many popular classes:

```{r}
methods(pander)
```

Also, `pander` is integrated with `knitr` by default. `pander` simply identifies if `knitr` is running in the background, and if so, it uses `capture.output` to return the resulting string as an `knit_asis` object, meaning that you do not need to specify the `results='asis'` option in your knitr chunk:

```{r, error = TRUE}
library(descr, quietly = TRUE)
pander(CrossTable(mtcars$gear, mtcars$cyl))
library(tables, quietly = TRUE)
tab <- tabular( (Species + 1) ~ (n=1) + Format(digits=2)*
         (Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width)*(mean + sd), data=iris )
pander(tab)
```

In a nutshell, this is achieved by modification that whenever you call `pander` inside of a `knitr` document, instead of returning the markdown text to the standard output (the default behavior), `pander` returns a `knit_asis` class object, which renders correctly in the resulting document â€” without the double comment chars, thus properly rendering the tables in HTML, PDF, or other document formats.

If you don't want the results of `pander` to be converted automatically, just set `knitr.auto.asis` to `FALSE`  using `panderOptions`:

```{r}
panderOptions('knitr.auto.asis', FALSE)
pander(head(iris))
```
```{r}
panderOptions('knitr.auto.asis', TRUE)
```

#### Rendering markdown inside loop/vectorized function

One frequenly asked question is how to use `pander` with `knitr` in a loop or vectorized function. For example, we have 3 tables that we want to render using `lapply`:

```{r}
dfs <- list(mtcars[1:3, 1:4], mtcars[4:6, 1:4], mtcars[7:9, 1:4])
lapply(dfs, pander)
```

As you can see, this doesn't work correctly because `pander` tries to return a `knit_asis` class object when run inside `knitr`,  but for loops/vectorized functions this results in incorrect output. The recommended way to solve this is to disable this behavior by setting `knitr.auto.asis` to `FALSE` using `panderOptions`. However, we also need to tell `knitr` to convert the table on the fly by specifying `results='asis'` in the chunk options:

```{r results='asis'}
panderOptions('knitr.auto.asis', FALSE)
dfs <- list(mtcars[1:3, 1:4], mtcars[4:6, 1:4], mtcars[7:9, 1:4])
invisible(lapply(dfs, pander))
```

default. <code>pander</code> simply identifies if <code>knitr</code> is
running in the background, and if so, it uses
<code>capture.output</code> to return the resulting string as an
<code>knit_asis</code> object, meaning that you do not need to specify
the <code>results=&#39;asis&#39;</code> option in your knitr chunk:</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this is achieved by modification that whenever you
call <code>pander</code> inside of a <code>knitr</code> document,
instead of returning the markdown text to the standard output (the
default behavior), <code>pander</code> returns a <code>knit_asis</code>
class object, which renders correctly in the resulting document â€”
without the double comment chars, thus properly rendering the tables in
HTML, PDF, or other document formats.</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t want the results of <code>pander</code> to be converted
automatically, just set <code>knitr.auto.asis</code> to
<code>FALSE</code> using <code>panderOptions</code>:</p>

<p>As you can see, this doesnâ€™t work correctly because
<code>pander</code> tries to return a <code>knit_asis</code> class
object when run inside <code>knitr</code>, but for loops/vectorized
functions this results in incorrect output. The recommended way to solve
this is to disable this behavior by setting <code>knitr.auto.asis</code>
to <code>FALSE</code> using <code>panderOptions</code>. However, we also
need to tell <code>knitr</code> to convert the table on the fly by
specifying <code>results=&#39;asis&#39;</code> in the chunk options:</p>

`Pander` is designed to provide a minimal and easy tool for rendering `R` objects into [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)'s markdown. This vignette aims to introduce the `pander` package and its core pieces of functionality. It is intended to be a general overview with pointers to places with detailed information. This vignette will talk about:

* core functionality for rendering objects in `Pandoc`'s markdown with generic S3 [pander method](#rendering-r-objects).
* functionality for capturing various information when evaluating R expressions with [evals](#evals).
* report generation with [Pandoc.brew](#brew-to-pandoc).
* globally adjustable options through [panderOptions/evalsOptions](#general-options).

## Rendering R objects

The core functionality of `pander` is centered around rendering `R` objects into `Pandoc`'s markdown. Let's dive in to a demo of the most common usage of `pander`:

```{r}
pander(head(iris))
pander(head(mtcars[1:5]))
pander(tabular( (Species + 1) ~ (n=1) + Format(digits=2)*
         (Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width)*(mean + sd), data=iris ))
```

As you have probably guessed, this is achieved via the generic `pander` `S3` method. Out of the box, `pander` supports a variety of classes:

```{r}
methods(pander)
```

If you think that pander lacks support for any other R class(es), please feel free to open a [ticket](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pulls) suggesting a new feature or submit [pull request](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues) and we will be happy to extend the package.

Under the hood, `pander` S3 methods rely on different `pandoc.*` methods, where most of functionality is implemented in `pandoc.table` which is used for rendering tables. `pandoc.table` provides functionality similar to `knitr::kable` in rendering markdown, but also adds a truly rich functionality with a variety of rendering options inherited from `pander`. For more usage/implementation details and examples, please refer to the `pandoc.table` vignette, which can be accessed by `vignette('pandoc_table')` (and is also available [online](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/pandoc_table.html)).

## Evals

The `pander` package was originally developed in conjunction with [rapport](https://github.com/Rapporter/rapport) package, when a need arose for a function that could evaluate `R` expressions while also capturing errors and warnings. So `evals` emerged and soon some further feature requests arose, like identifying if an R expression results in a plot, etc.

But probably it's easier to explain what `evals` can do with a simple example:

```{r}
evals('1:10')
```

`evals` is aimed at collecting as much information as possible while evaluating R code. It can evaluate a character vector of R expressions, and it returns a list of information captured while running them:

* `src` holds the R expression,
* `result` contains the raw R object as-is,
* `output` represents how the R object is printed to the standard output,
* `type` is the class of the returned R object,
* `msg` is a list of possible messages captured while evaluating the R expression. Among other messages, warnings/errors will appear here.
* `stdout` contains what, if anything, was written to the standard output.

For more usage/implementation details and examples, please refer to the `evals` vignette, which can be accessed by `vignette('evals')` (also available [online](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/evals.html)).

## Brew to Pandoc

The [brew](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brew) package, a templating framework for report generation, has not been updated since 2011, but it's still some of R projects based on its simple design and useful literate programming features. For a quick overview, please see the following documents if you are not familiar with brew:

* [slides on "Building a reporting sytem with BREW"](https://www.slideshare.net/xavierguardiola/building-a-reporting-sytem-with-brew)
* [learnr blogpost on brew](https://learnr.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/brew-creating-repetitive-reports/)

A brew document is a simple text file with some special tags. `Pandoc.brew` uses only two of them (as building on a personalized version of Jeff's really great brew function):

* `<% ... %>` stands for running inline R commands as usual,
* `<%= ... %>` does pretty much the same but applies pander to the returning R object (instead of `cat` like the original brew function does). So inserting any R object into the tag would return it in Pandoc markdown format, with all possible error/warning messages, etc.

The latter tries to be smart in some ways:

* A code chunk block (`R` commands between the tags) can return any number of values at any part of the block.
* Plots and images are grabbed in the document, rendered to a png file and pander method would result in a Pandoc markdown formatted image link. This means that the image would be rendered/shown/included in the exported document.
* All warnings/messages and errors are recorded in the blocks and returned in the document as footnotes or inline messages.
* All heavy `R` commands (e.g. those taking more then 0.1 sec to evaluate) are cached so rebrewing a report would not result in a coffee break.

Besides this, the custom brew function can do more and also less compared to the original brew package. First of all, the internal caching mechanism of brew has been rewritten for benefits besides improved caching. Quick example:

```{r}
str(Pandoc.brew(text ='Pi equals to `<%= pi %>`. And here are some random data: `<%= runif(10)%>`'))
```

The package bundles some examples for `Pandoc.brew` to let you quickly check its features.
To brew these examples on your machine, run the following commands:

```
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/minimal.brew', package='pander'))
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/minimal.brew', package='pander'),
            output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')

Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/short-code-long-report.brew', package='pander'))
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/short-code-long-report.brew', package='pander'),
                        output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')

Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/graphs.brew', package='pander'))
Pandoc.brew(system.file('examples/graphs.brew', package='pander'),
                        output = tempfile(), convert = 'html')
```

## General Options

The package comes with a variety of globally adjustable options that have an effect on the result of your reports. A full list of options can be viewed by calling `?panderOptions` or in the online [readme](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander#general-options).

You can query and update these options with the `panderOptions` function:

```{r}
pots <- panderOptions("table.style")
panderOptions("table.style", "simple")
pander(mtcars[1:3, 1:4])
pander(head(iris))
panderOptions("table.style", "grid")
pander(head(iris))
panderOptions("table.style", pots)
```

<p><code>Pander</code> is designed to provide a minimal and easy tool
for rendering <code>R</code> objects into <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>â€™s markdown. This vignette aims to
introduce the <code>pander</code> package and its core pieces of
functionality. It is intended to be a general overview with pointers to
places with detailed information. This vignette will talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>core functionality for rendering objects in <code>Pandoc</code>â€™s
markdown with generic S3 <a href="#rendering-r-objects">pander
method</a>.</li>
<li>functionality for capturing various information when evaluating R
expressions with <a href="#evals">evals</a>.</li>
<li>report generation with <a href="#brew-to-pandoc">Pandoc.brew</a>.</li>
<li>globally adjustable options through <a href="#general-options">panderOptions/evalsOptions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rendering R objects</h2>
<p>The core functionality of <code>pander</code> is centered around
rendering <code>R</code> objects into <code>Pandoc</code>â€™s markdown.

<p>If you think that pander lacks support for any other R class(es),
please feel free to open a <a href="https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/pulls">ticket</a> suggesting a
new feature or submit <a href="https://github.com/Rapporter/pander/issues">pull request</a> and
we will be happy to extend the package.</p>
<p>Under the hood, <code>pander</code> S3 methods rely on different
<code>pandoc.*</code> methods, where most of functionality is
implemented in <code>pandoc.table</code> which is used for rendering
tables. <code>pandoc.table</code> provides functionality similar to
<code>knitr::kable</code> in rendering markdown, but also adds a truly
rich functionality with a variety of rendering options inherited from
<code>pander</code>. For more usage/implementation details and examples,
please refer to the <code>pandoc.table</code> vignette, which can be
accessed by <code>vignette(&#39;pandoc_table&#39;)</code> (and is also available
<a href="https://rapporter.github.io/pander/pandoc_table.html">online</a>).</p>

<h2>Evals</h2>
<p>The <code>pander</code> package was originally developed in
conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/Rapporter/rapport">rapport</a> package, when a
need arose for a function that could evaluate <code>R</code> expressions
while also capturing errors and warnings. So <code>evals</code> emerged
and soon some further feature requests arose, like identifying if an R
expression results in a plot, etc.</p>
<p>But probably itâ€™s easier to explain what <code>evals</code> can do
with a simple example:</p>

<p><code>evals</code> is aimed at collecting as much information as
possible while evaluating R code. It can evaluate a character vector of
R expressions, and it returns a list of information captured while
running them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src</code> holds the R expression,</li>
<li><code>result</code> contains the raw R object as-is,</li>
<li><code>output</code> represents how the R object is printed to the
standard output,</li>
<li><code>type</code> is the class of the returned R object,</li>
<li><code>msg</code> is a list of possible messages captured while
evaluating the R expression. Among other messages, warnings/errors will
appear here.</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> contains what, if anything, was written to the
standard output.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more usage/implementation details and examples, please refer to
the <code>evals</code> vignette, which can be accessed by
<code>vignette(&#39;evals&#39;)</code> (also available <a href="https://rapporter.github.io/pander/evals.html">online</a>).</p>

<div id="brew-to-pandoc" class="section level2">
<h2>Brew to Pandoc</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=brew">brew</a>
package, a templating framework for report generation, has not been
updated since 2011, but itâ€™s still some of R projects based on its
simple design and useful literate programming features. For a quick
overview, please see the following documents if you are not familiar
with brew:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/xavierguardiola/building-a-reporting-sytem-with-brew">slides
on â€œBuilding a reporting sytem with BREWâ€</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnr.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/brew-creating-repetitive-reports/">learnr
blogpost on brew</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A brew document is a simple text file with some special tags.
<code>Pandoc.brew</code> uses only two of them (as building on a
personalized version of Jeffâ€™s really great brew function):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> stands for running inline R commands as
usual,</li>
<li><code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code> does pretty much the same but applies
pander to the returning R object (instead of <code>cat</code> like the
original brew function does). So inserting any R object into the tag
would return it in Pandoc markdown format, with all possible
error/warning messages, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter tries to be smart in some ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A code chunk block (<code>R</code> commands between the tags) can
return any number of values at any part of the block.</li>
<li>Plots and images are grabbed in the document, rendered to a png file
and pander method would result in a Pandoc markdown formatted image
link. This means that the image would be rendered/shown/included in the
exported document.</li>
<li>All warnings/messages and errors are recorded in the blocks and
returned in the document as footnotes or inline messages.</li>
<li>All heavy <code>R</code> commands (e.g.Â those taking more then 0.1
sec to evaluate) are cached so rebrewing a report would not result in a
coffee break.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides this, the custom brew function can do more and also less
compared to the original brew package. First of all, the internal
caching mechanism of brew has been rewritten for benefits besides
improved caching. Quick example:</p>

library(pander)
```

Core functionality of `pander` is centered around `pandoc.table`, which is aimed at rendering tables in `markdown`. In case of 2D tables, `pander` calls `pandoc.table` internally, thus in such cases `pander` and `pandoc.table` support the same argument and in this vignette will be used iterchangingly. `pandoc.table` has a wide variety of options ([highlighting](#highlighting-cells), [styles](#table-styles), etc.) and this vignette aims to give a more detailed overview of the most common options. `pander` comes with a variety of globally adjustable options, which have an effect on the result of your reports. You can query and update these options with the `panderOptions` function.

## Table styles

Since `pander` aims at rendering R objects into [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)'s markdown all four (`multiline`, `simple`, `grid`, `rmarkdown`) of  [Pandoc](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#tables)'s formats are supported. Users are advised to stick with the default `multiline` style, but if there is a need to change it either specify `style` argument when calling `pander/pandoc.table` or change the default `style` using `panderOptions`.

### multiline tables

`multiline` tables allow headers and table rows to span multiple lines of text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of the table are not supported). Also note that, for simplicity, line breaks are removed from cells by default, so multiline cells are typically the result of [splitting large cells](#table-and-cell-width) or setting `keep.line.breaks` to `TRUE`:

```{r}
m <- data.frame('Value\n1', 'Value\n2')
colnames(m) <- c('Multiline\nCol1', 'Multiline\nCol2')
pandoc.table(m, keep.line.breaks = TRUE)
m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:4]
pandoc.table(m)
```

### simple tables

`simple` tables are have more compact syntax that all other styles, but don't they support multiline cells:

```{r, error=TRUE}
m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:4]
pandoc.table(m, style = 'simple')
m <- data.frame('Value\n1', 'Value\n2')
colnames(m) <- c('Multiline\nCol1', 'Multiline\nCol2')
pandoc.table(m, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style='simple')
```

### grid tables

`grid` format is really handy for `emacs` users ([Emacs table mod](http://table.sourceforge.net/)) and it does support block elements (multiple paragraphs, code blocks, lists, etc.) inside cells, but cells can't span multiple columns or rows. Alignments are not supported for grid tables by most parsers, meaning that even though `pander` will produce a table with alignment, it will be lost during conversion from `markdown` to `HTML/PDF/DOCX`.

```{r, error=TRUE}
m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:4]
pandoc.table(m, style = 'grid')
m <- data.frame('Value\n1', 'Value\n2')
colnames(m) <- c('Multiline\nCol1', 'Multiline\nCol2')
pandoc.table(m, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style='grid')
```

### rmarkdown tables

`rmarkdown` or pipe table format, is often used directly with `knitr`, since it was supported by the first versions of the `markdown` package. It is similar to `simple` table in that multiline cells are also not supported. The beginning and ending pipe characters are optional, but pipes are required between all columns:

```{r, error=TRUE}
m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:4]
pandoc.table(m, style = 'rmarkdown')
m <- data.frame('Value\n1', 'Value\n2')
colnames(m) <- c('Multiline\nCol1', 'Multiline\nCol2')
pandoc.table(m, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style='rmarkdown')
```

## Cell alignment

`pander` allows users to control cell alignment (`left`, `right` or `center/centre`) in a table directly by setting the `justify` parameter when calling `pander/pandoc.table`. Note that it is possible to specify alignment for each column separately by supplying a vector to justify:

```{r}
pandoc.table(head(iris[,1:3], 2), justify = 'right')
pandoc.table(head(iris[,1:3], 2), justify = c('right', 'center', 'left'))
```

Another  way to define alignment is by using a permanent option `table.alignment.default/table.alignment.rownames` in `panderOptions` (preferred way) or by using `set.alignment` function (legacy way of setting alignment for next table or permanently) which support setting alignment separately for cells and rownames:

```{r}
set.alignment('left', row.names = 'right') # set only for next table since permanent parameter is falce
pandoc.table(mtcars[1:2,  1:5])
```

Interesting application for this functionality is specifying a function that takes the R object as its argument to compute some unique alignment for your table based on e.g. column values or variable types:

```{r}
panderOptions('table.alignment.default',
    function(df)
        ifelse(sapply(df, mean) > 2, 'left', 'right'))
pandoc.table(head(iris[,1:3], 2))
panderOptions('table.alignment.default', 'center')
```
## Highlighting cells

One of the great features of `pander` is the ease of highlighting rows, columns and cells in a table. This is a native `markdown` feature without custom `HTML` or `LaTeX`-only tweaks, so all `HTML/PDF/MS Word/OpenOffice` etc. formats are supported.

This can be achieved by specifying one of the arguments below when calling `pander`/`pandoc.table` or change default style using `panderOptions`:

* emphasize.italics.rows
* emphasize.italics.cols
* emphasize.italics.cells
* emphasize.strong.rows
* emphasize.strong.cols
* emphasize.strong.cells
* emphasize.verbatim.rows
* emphasize.verbatim.cols
* emphasize.verbatim.cells

The `emphasize.italics` helpers would turn the affected cells to *italic*, `emphasize.strong` would apply a **bold** style to the cell and `emphasize.verbatim` would apply a `verbatim` style to the cell. A cell can be also *italic*,  **bold** and `verbatim` at the same time.

Those functions and arguments ending in rows or cols take a vector (like which columns or rows to emphasize in a table), while the cells argument take either a vector (for one dimensional "tables") or an array-like data structure with two columns holding row and column indexes of cells to be emphasized -- just like what `which(..., arr.ind = TRUE)` returns:

```{r}
t <- mtcars[1:3, 1:5]
emphasize.italics.cols(1)
emphasize.italics.rows(1)
emphasize.strong.cells(which(t > 20, arr.ind = TRUE))
pandoc.table(t)
pandoc.table(t, emphasize.verbatim.rows = 1, emphasize.strong.cells = which(t > 20, arr.ind = TRUE))
```

For more elaborative examples, please see our blog post - [Highlight cells in markdown tables](http://blog.rapporter.net/2013/04/hihglight-cells-in-markdown-tables.html).

## Table and Cell width

`pander/pandoc.table` is able to deal with wide tables. Ever had an issue in `LaTeX` or `MS Word` when trying to print a correlation matrix of 40 variables? This problem is carefully addressed with `split.table` parameter:

```{r}
pandoc.table(mtcars[1:2, ], style = "grid", caption = "Wide table to be split!")
```

`split.table` defaults to 80 characters and to turn it off, set `split.table` to `Inf`:

```{r}
pandoc.table(mtcars[1:2, ], style = "grid",
             caption = "Wide table to be split!", split.table = Inf)
```

Also, `pander` tries to split too wide cells into multiline cells. The maximum number of characters in a cell is specified by the `split.cells` parameter (defaults to 30), which can be a single value, vector (values for each column separately) and relative vector (percentages of `split.tables` parameter). Please not that this only works for `multiline` and `grid` tables:

```{r, error=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(a = 'Lorem ipsum', b = 'dolor sit', c = 'amet')
pandoc.table(df, split.cells = 5)
pandoc.table(df, split.cells = c(5, 20, 5))
pandoc.table(df, split.cells = c("80%", "10%", "10%"))
pandoc.table(df, split.cells = 5, style = 'simple')
```

In some cases it is also useful to split too long words with hyphens, and `pander` uses `sylly` functionality for that. Just specify `use.hyphening` argument and have `sylly` installed:

```{r}
pandoc.table(data.frame(baz = 'foobar', foo='accoutrements'),
             use.hyphening = TRUE, split.cells = 3)
```

## Rounding and number formatting

`pander/pandoc.table` deals with formatting numbers by having 4 parameters:

* `round` to the number of decimal places.
* `digits` to specify how many significant digits are to be used for numeric
* `decimal.mark/big.mark` to specify character for decimal point/orders of magnitude

`round` and `digits` parameter can be a vector specifying values for each column (has to be the same length as number of columns). Values for non-numeric columns will be disregarded.

Now let's get to some examples:
```{r}
r <- matrix(c(283764.97430, 29.12345678901, -7.1234, -100.1), ncol = 2)
pandoc.table(r, round = 2)
pandoc.table(r, round = c(4,2)) # vector for each column
pandoc.table(r, digits = 2)
pandoc.table(r, digits = c(1, 5)) # vector for each column
pandoc.table(r, big.mark = ',')
pandoc.table(r, decimal.mark = ',')
```
## Other options

Functionality described in other sections is most notable, but `pander/pandoc.table` also has smaller nifty features that are worth mentioning:

* `plain.ascii` - allows to have the output without `markdown` markup:
```{r}
pandoc.table(mtcars[1:3, 1:4])
pandoc.table(mtcars[1:3, 1:4], plain.ascii = TRUE)
```

* `caption` - set caption (string) to be shown under the table:
```{r}
pandoc.table(mtcars[1:3, 1:5], style = "grid", caption = "My caption!")
```

* `missing` - set a string to replace missing values:
```{r}
m <- mtcars[1:3, 1:5]
m$mpg <- NA
pandoc.table(m, missing = '?')
```

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Rendering tables with pandoc.table</h1>
<h4 class="author">Roman Tsegelskyi, Gergely DarÃ³czi</h4>
<h4 class="date">2022-03-18</h4>



<p>Core functionality of <code>pander</code> is centered around
<code>pandoc.table</code>, which is aimed at rendering tables in
<code>markdown</code>. In case of 2D tables, <code>pander</code> calls
<code>pandoc.table</code> internally, thus in such cases
<code>pander</code> and <code>pandoc.table</code> support the same
argument and in this vignette will be used iterchangingly.
<code>pandoc.table</code> has a wide variety of options (<a href="#highlighting-cells">highlighting</a>, <a href="#table-styles">styles</a>, etc.) and this vignette aims to give a
more detailed overview of the most common options. <code>pander</code>
comes with a variety of globally adjustable options, which have an
effect on the result of your reports. You can query and update these
options with the <code>panderOptions</code> function.</p>
<div id="table-styles" class="section level2">
<h2>Table styles</h2>
<p>Since <code>pander</code> aims at rendering R objects into <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>â€™s markdown all four
(<code>multiline</code>, <code>simple</code>, <code>grid</code>,
<code>rmarkdown</code>) of <a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#tables">Pandoc</a>â€™s
formats are supported. Users are advised to stick with the default
<code>multiline</code> style, but if there is a need to change it either
specify <code>style</code> argument when calling
<code>pander/pandoc.table</code> or change the default
<code>style</code> using <code>panderOptions</code>.</p>
<div id="multiline-tables" class="section level3">
<h3>multiline tables</h3>
<p><code>multiline</code> tables allow headers and table rows to span
multiple lines of text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of
the table are not supported). Also note that, for simplicity, line
breaks are removed from cells by default, so multiline cells are
typically the result of <a href="#table-and-cell-width">splitting large
cells</a> or setting <code>keep.line.breaks</code> to
<code>TRUE</code>:</p>

<div id="grid-tables" class="section level3">
<h3>grid tables</h3>
<p><code>grid</code> format is really handy for <code>emacs</code> users
(<a href="http://table.sourceforge.net/">Emacs table mod</a>) and it
does support block elements (multiple paragraphs, code blocks, lists,
etc.) inside cells, but cells canâ€™t span multiple columns or rows.
Alignments are not supported for grid tables by most parsers, meaning
that even though <code>pander</code> will produce a table with
alignment, it will be lost during conversion from <code>markdown</code>
to <code>HTML/PDF/DOCX</code>.</p>

<p>Another way to define alignment is by using a permanent option
<code>table.alignment.default/table.alignment.rownames</code> in
<code>panderOptions</code> (preferred way) or by using
<code>set.alignment</code> function (legacy way of setting alignment for
next table or permanently) which support setting alignment separately
for cells and rownames:</p>

<h2>Highlighting cells</h2>
<p>One of the great features of <code>pander</code> is the ease of
highlighting rows, columns and cells in a table. This is a native
<code>markdown</code> feature without custom <code>HTML</code> or
<code>LaTeX</code>-only tweaks, so all
<code>HTML/PDF/MS Word/OpenOffice</code> etc. formats are supported.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by specifying one of the arguments below when
calling <code>pander</code>/<code>pandoc.table</code> or change default
style using <code>panderOptions</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>emphasize.italics.rows</li>
<li>emphasize.italics.cols</li>
<li>emphasize.italics.cells</li>
<li>emphasize.strong.rows</li>
<li>emphasize.strong.cols</li>
<li>emphasize.strong.cells</li>
<li>emphasize.verbatim.rows</li>
<li>emphasize.verbatim.cols</li>
<li>emphasize.verbatim.cells</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>emphasize.italics</code> helpers would turn the affected
cells to <em>italic</em>, <code>emphasize.strong</code> would apply a
<strong>bold</strong> style to the cell and
<code>emphasize.verbatim</code> would apply a <code>verbatim</code>
style to the cell. A cell can be also <em>italic</em>,
<strong>bold</strong> and <code>verbatim</code> at the same time.</p>
<p>Those functions and arguments ending in rows or cols take a vector
(like which columns or rows to emphasize in a table), while the cells
argument take either a vector (for one dimensional â€œtablesâ€) or an
array-like data structure with two columns holding row and column
indexes of cells to be emphasized â€“ just like what
<code>which(..., arr.ind = TRUE)</code> returns:</p>

<p>Also, <code>pander</code> tries to split too wide cells into
multiline cells. The maximum number of characters in a cell is specified
by the <code>split.cells</code> parameter (defaults to 30), which can be
a single value, vector (values for each column separately) and relative
vector (percentages of <code>split.tables</code> parameter). Please not
that this only works for <code>multiline</code> and <code>grid</code>
tables:</p>

<p>In some cases it is also useful to split too long words with hyphens,
and <code>pander</code> uses <code>sylly</code> functionality for that.
Just specify <code>use.hyphening</code> argument and have

<h2>Rounding and number formatting</h2>
<p><code>pander/pandoc.table</code> deals with formatting numbers by
having 4 parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>round</code> to the number of decimal places.</li>
<li><code>digits</code> to specify how many significant digits are to be
used for numeric</li>
<li><code>decimal.mark/big.mark</code> to specify character for decimal
point/orders of magnitude</li>
</ul>
<p><code>round</code> and <code>digits</code> parameter can be a vector
specifying values for each column (has to be the same length as number
of columns). Values for non-numeric columns will be disregarded.</p>

% Unified plots

This document demonstrates the features of unifying plots in `pander`. First, if you do not want to deal with styling each of your images, just activate it: `evalsOptions('graph.unify', TRUE)`.

*Note*: please install `lattice` and `ggplot2` on your computer prior to trying to run all examples of this document.

# Options

There are a bunch of options you might want to check out, these are:

<%=as.list(names(panderOptions())[grepl('^graph', names(panderOptions()))])%>

Find more details on [`pander`'s homepage](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/#pander-options).

# Default options

Not touching the above ones, let us check out how different plots look like by calling `base` R graphing function, `lattice` or `ggplot2`!

## Histogram

### Base R plot

<%=hist(df$hp, main = "Histogram in base R")%>

### lattice

<%=histogram(df$hp, main = "Histogram with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hp), binwidth = 50) + ggtitle("Histogram with ggplot2")%>

## Barplot

### Base R plot

<%=barplot(table(df$factor), main = "Barplot in base R")%>

### lattice

<%=barchart(df$factor, main = "Barplot with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(x = factor)) + ggtitle("Barplot with ggplot2")%>

## Points

### Base R plot

<%=plot(df$hp, df$wt, main = "Points in base R")%>

### lattice

<%=xyplot(df$wt ~ df$hp, main = "Points with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = wt)) + ggtitle("Points with ggplot2")%>

## Grouped plot

### Base R plot

I have no idea how to do that besides manually adding `points`.

### lattice

<%=xyplot(wt ~ hp, group = factor, data = df, auto.key = TRUE, main = "Grouped plot with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = wt, colour = factor)) + ggtitle("Grouped bar with ggplot2")%>

## Facets

### Base R plot

I have no idea how to do that besides `par(mfrow=c(foo, bar))`.

### lattice

<%=barchart(table(df$factor,df$factor2), groups = FALSE, layout = c(1,3), main = "Faceted barplot with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(x = factor)) + ggtitle("Faceted barplot with ggplot2") + facet_grid(factor2 ~ .)%>

## Boxplot

### Base R plot

<%=boxplot(df$hp ~ df$factor, main = "Boxplot in base R")%>

### lattice

<%=bwplot(df$factor ~ df$hp, main = "Boxplot with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_boxplot(aes(y = hp, x = factor)) + ggtitle("Boxplot with ggplot2")%>


## Lines

### Base R plot

<%=plot(df$time, df$hp, type = 'l')%>

### lattice

<%=xyplot(df$hp ~ df$time, type = 'l')%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_line(aes(x = time, y = hp))%>

# Custom options

Below you can find some images generated by the exact same commands but with some modified `panderOptions`:

```r
panderOptions('graph.fontfamily', "Comic Sans MS")
panderOptions('graph.fontsize', 18)
panderOptions('graph.fontcolor', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.grid.color', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.axis.angle', 3)
panderOptions('graph.boxes', T)
panderOptions('graph.legend.position', 'top')
panderOptions('graph.colors', rainbow(5))
panderOptions('graph.grid', FALSE)
panderOptions('graph.symbol', 22)
```

<%
panderOptions('graph.fontfamily', "Comic Sans MS")
panderOptions('graph.fontsize', 18)
panderOptions('graph.fontcolor', 'blue')
panderOptions('graph.grid.color', 'blue')

panderOptions('graph.legend.position', 'top')
panderOptions('graph.colors', rainbow(5))
panderOptions('graph.grid', FALSE)
panderOptions('graph.symbol', 22)
%>

## Histogram

### Base R plot

<%=hist(df$hp, main = "Histogram in base R")%>

### lattice

<%=histogram(df$hp, main = "Histogram with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hp), binwidth = 50) + ggtitle("Histogram with ggplot2")%>

## Barplot

### Base R plot

<%=barplot(table(df$factor), main = "Barplot in base R")%>

Yeah, the "Foo bar" label is cropped. We need a custom `mar` option here:

<%=par(mar=c(6, 4.3, 2.1, 0.1));+barplot(table(df$factor), main = "Barplot in base R")%>

But wait, we lost the color! Right: unfortunately coloring base R plots is really hackish, `pander` is adding the `col` attribute to the calls. If you start to tweak `par` in a chunk, you should prepare to some unwanted side-effects. Solution:

<%=par(mar=c(6, 4.3, 2.1, 0.1));+barplot(table(df$factor), main = "Barplot in base R", col = panderOptions('graph.colors')[1])%>

### lattice

<%=barchart(df$factor, main = "Barplot with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(x = factor)) + ggtitle("Barplot with ggplot2")%>

## Points

### Base R plot

<%=plot(df$hp, df$wt, main = "Points in base R")%>

### lattice

<%=xyplot(df$wt ~ df$hp, main = "Points with lattice")%>

### ggplot2

<%=ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = wt)) + ggtitle("Points with ggplot2")%>

## Grouped plot

### Base R plot

I have no idea how to do that besides manually adding `points`.

### lattice

<%=xyplot(wt ~ hp, group = factor, data = df, auto.key = TRUE, main = "Grouped plot with lattice")%>

% Minimal example for `Pandoc.brew`

# Introduction

We have two meta-information above:

  * author
  * title

A third field could be there too: date. For details, please check out [Pandoc's homepage](https://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#title-block) or just use `pandoc.title` function of this package.

As you can see writing and formatting paragraphs cannot be easier :)

But what about [R](https://www.r-project.org/)? Let us return pi: <%=pi%>

# R objects

`Pander.brew` would transform any returned R object to Pandoc's markdown in each code block.

For example `mtcars`'s first 5 cases look like:

<%=mtcars[1:5, ]%>

As you can see some formatting was added to the returned table and was also split up as the original table would have been too wide to fit on the screen (any `pander`er still using a VT100 terminal?) or standard paper. If you do not like that split up, just set the according [`panderOption`](https://rapporter.github.io/pander/#pander-options)!

We could try other R objects too, for example let us check `chisq.test` on some variables of `mtcars`:

<%=chisq.test(mtcars$am, mtcars$gear)%>

And we got a warning above!

## Returning plot

Plots are automatically grabbed between `brew` tags and some custom formatting applied (if `evalsOptions('graph.unify')` is set to `TRUE`):

<%=
if (require(lattice, quietly = TRUE)) {
    histogram(mtcars$hp)
}
%>

The above `lattice` looks (IMHO) pretty cool, but what about using `base` plot?

<%=
hist(mtcars$hp)
%>

This should be quite similar by my intention :)

What about `ggplot2`?

<%=
if (require(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)) {
    ggplot(mtcars) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hp))
}
%>

And adding a caption is easy with even some modified `panderOptions`:

<%=
temp <- panderOptions('graph.grid.color')
panderOptions('graph.grid.color', 'red')
set.caption('This is a caption, right?')
histogram(mtcars$hp)
panderOptions('graph.grid.color', temp)
%>

# Captions

Just like with tables:

<%=
set.caption('Here goes the first two lines of USArrests')
USArrests[1:2,]
%>

# Multiple results

And the chunks can result in multiple R objects of course:

<%=
list(1:5)
list(pi)
list(mtcars$hp)
%>

# It happens

<%=
mean(unknown.R.object)
%>

We have fetched some data from [databaseolympics.com](<%=url%>):

<%=d%>

<%=
    ## removing events which seem to be invalid
    if (length(dEvents.invalid) > 0)
        d <- d[-dEvents.invalid, ]

    ## just dealing with the winners ATM
    golddata <- subset(d, Medal %in% "GOLD")

    ## removing duplicated rows (we just need the Results)
    if (any(table(golddata['Year']) > 1))
        golddata <- golddata[-which(duplicated(golddata['Year'])), ]

    ## are we dealing with time results?
    resultInTime <- any(grepl(':', golddata$Result))

    ## transforming data
    d$Event            <- as.character(d$Event)
    golddata$Year      <- as.numeric(as.character(golddata$Year))
    years              <- c(as.numeric(as.character(sort(unique(golddata$Year)))), 2012)
    golddata$Result    <- rms(as.character(golddata$Result), resultInTime)
    rownames(golddata) <- NULL
%>

And applied some filters and data transformation on the above database to let us create a data set ready for the below analysis:

<%=
if (weight)
    golddata$weight <- (golddata$Year - min(golddata$Year) + 4) / sum(golddata$Year - min(golddata$Year) + 4) * length(golddata$Year)
golddata
%>

<%
if (nrow(golddata) > 5) {
%>

We do not even need all columns of this table, we will deal only with *Year* and the *Result* below which is eligible to build some simple statistical models to predict the expected results in 2012.

Please note that the below estimates are not based on any causal model, nor we claim it could be accomplished. We just demonstrate: these numbers can be expected leaning solely on prior Olympic records.

<%=
    ## fitting a non-linear model
    if (weight) {
        nonLin     <- suppressWarnings(lm(Result ~ poly(Year, 4), weights = weight, data = golddata))
    } else {
        nonLin     <- suppressWarnings(lm(Result ~ poly(Year, 4), data = golddata))
    }
    nonLin.name    <- 'power prediction'
    nonLin.predict <- suppressWarnings(predict(nonLin, newdata = data.frame(Year = years)))
    nonLin.width   <- (100 - ((1 - mean(summary(nonLin)$coefficients[, "Pr(>|t|)"]))^2 * 100)) + (1 - summary(nonLin)$adj.r.squared) * 100
    golddata2012   <- rbind(golddata, c(2012, rep(NA, times = ncol(golddata)-1)))
    golddata2012$nonLin <- nonLin.predict
    names(nonLin$coefficients )[1:5] <- c('Intercept', 'Year', 'Year^2', 'Year^3', 'Year^4')

    ## fitting a log-linear model
    if (weight) {
        logLin      <- lm(log(Result) ~ Year, weights = weight, data = golddata)
    } else {
        logLin      <- lm(log(Result) ~ Year, data = golddata)
    }
    logLin.name     <- 'simple prediction'
    logLin.predict  <- exp(predict(logLin, newdata = data.frame(Year = years)))
    logLin.width    <- (100 - ((1 - mean(summary(logLin)$coefficients[, "Pr(>|t|)"]))^2 * 100)) + (1 - summary(logLin)$adj.r.squared) * 100
    golddata2012$logLin <- logLin.predict
%>

### Visualized models and predictions

We have built two different models: a log-linear (*simple*) and a non-linear (*power*) one. Weights were <%=ifelse(weight, '', 'not')%> applied.

Both models on a complex plot build with `base` R (actually with `graphics` functions):

<%=
    ## saving options as tweaking some internals
    evalsOptions('graph.unify', FALSE)
%><%=
    ## plotting
    models <- c('nonLin', 'logLin')
    plotPredictions(golddata, models)
%><%=
    ## reset graph unify option
    evalsOptions('graph.unify', TRUE)
%>

Another quick plot themed by our [back-end](http://daroczig.github.com/pander/) building on `ggplot2`:

<%=
g <- ggplot(golddata2012) + geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=Result)) + geom_smooth(aes(x=Year, y=nonLin), alpha=0.2) + geom_smooth(aes(x=Year, y=logLin, col = "#56B4E9"), alpha=0.2, col = "#009E73") + ggtitle(d$Event[1]) + ylab("") + xlab("") + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "none")
if (resultInTime)
    g <- g + scale_y_continuous(labels = ms)
g
%>

## The models in more details

### Non-linear model

Fitting a non-linear model on the winning times cannot be easier from a client's point of view with Rapporter:

<%=
    ## printing
    nonLin
%>

#### Validations of the Model Assumptions

And checking the assumptions of the fitted model could be also useful: <%=
a <- summary(gvlma(nonLin))
ifelse(any(a$Decision == 'Assumptions NOT satisfied!'), 'it seems that some assumptions of the model was *not* satisfied!', 'all the assumptions of the model were satisfied!')
%>

In details:

<%=
pandoc.table.return(a, split.tables = Inf)
%>

#### Diagnostic plots

Professional users might find the diagnostic plots of R helpful too. Here you can find a default plot with Rapporter's automatically applied theme:

<%=
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
+suppressWarnings(plot(nonLin))
%>

But back to the model: the adjusted R-squared equals to <%=summary(nonLin)$adj.r.squared%> with a p-value of <%=round(anova(nonLin)$'Pr(>F)'[1], 5)%>.

<%=anova(nonLin)%>

### Log-linear model

And our log-linear model looks like:

<%=
    ## printing
    logLin
%>

#### Validations of the Model Assumptions

Where <%=
a <- summary(gvlma(logLin))
ifelse(any(a$Decision == 'Assumptions NOT satisfied!'), 'some assumptions were *not* satisfied:', 'the assumptions were satisfied:')
%>

<%=
pandoc.table.return(a, split.tables = Inf)
%>

#### Diagnostic plots

And the diagnostic plots again:

<%=
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
+suppressWarnings(plot(logLin))
%>

Where the adjusted R-squared equals to <%=summary(logLin)$adj.r.squared%> with a p-value of <%=round(anova(logLin)$'Pr(>F)'[1], 5)%>.

<%=anova(logLin)%>

#### We really hope that you like this short demo, please do not forget to [sign up for our forthcoming next-generation web application](http://rapporter.net) to create your own report!

## Bye!

<% } else { %>

We are really sorry, but we cannot build a model from only *<%=nrow(golddata)%>* result<%=ifelse(nrow(golddata) > 1, 's', '')%> at the Olympics.

**Please try another sport event!**

I have written the below report in 10 mins :)

# Dataset

Here I will do a pretty fast report on `mtcars` which is:

<%=
mtcars
%>

# Descriptives

<%=
data.frame("Average" = sapply(mtcars, mean), "Median" = sapply(mtcars, median), "Standard deviation" = sapply(mtcars, sd), "Variance" = sapply(mtcars, var))
%>

## In details

<%
for (v in names(mtcars)) {
%>

### <%=v%>

We found the folloing values here:

<%=
mtcars[, v]
%>

The mean of <%=v%> is <%=mean(mtcars[, v])%> while the standard deviation is: <%=sd(mtcars[, v])%>. The most frequent value in <%=v%> is <%=names(sort(table(mtcars[, v]), decreasing =TRUE))[1]%>, but let us check out the frequency table too:

<%=
table(mtcars[, v])
%>

Tables are boring, let us show the same with a `histogram`:

<%=
require(lattice)
histogram(mtcars[, v], xlab = v, col = sample(colors(), 1))
%>

<%
}
%>

# Correlation

And here goes a correlation table:

<%=
cor(mtcars)
%>

And the same on a graph:

<%=
I.have.time <- FALSE
if (I.have.time)
   pairs(mtcars)
%>

Yeah, that latter took a while to render in an image file :)

That's not a `pander` issue.

# Some models

Okay, let us find out how `weight` affects other variables:

<%
for (v in names(mtcars)[-6]) {
%>

### <%=v%>

A simple linear model: `mtcars$wt ~ mtcars$<%=v%>`

<%=
Independent <- mtcars[, v]
lm(mtcars$wt ~ Independent)
%>

<%
}
%>
